071_053_003_03_17.png,the catalogue of punishments .,30
071_053_003_03_18.png,3 . Another reason against applying extraodinary punishment,59
071_053_003_03_19.png,in the case of domestic theft is their being subject to a,57
071_053_003_03_21.png,check to which either strangers are not exposed . The most,58
071_053_003_03_23.png,valuable possession a stranger has is his character this,56

071_053_004_03_08.png,any of the kinds now under consideration . Now the more,55
071_053_004_03_10.png,powerfully a man is acted upon in direction by other,52
071_053_004_03_11.png,powers with the less force is it necessary to act upon,54
071_053_004_03_12.png,him in the way of punishment,28
071_053_004_03_13.png,4 :  But the most forcible objection of all seems to be,55

071_054_001_03_07.png,have frequent occasions to converse & they become habituated,60
