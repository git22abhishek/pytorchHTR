a04-092-10.png,ok,to the policy of the United States.,182
a04-096-00.png,ok,The second reason is concerned with doubts,182

a04-096-02.png,ok,"""in the time of crisis it would probably be",182

a04-096-07.png,ok,as there is a Polaris base in Britain the,182

d01-060-00.png,ok,At first sight the difference between,191

d01-080-00.png,ok,"The bar was the commonest marking, but others",154

d01-085-00.png,err,Professor E. G. Turner is inclined to take the view that,153

d01-085-03.png,ok,"whether paragraphed or not, would be laid out in",152

d01-098-02.png,ok,a simple and serviceable book. It was robust - the number,180
d01-098-03.png,ok,which have survived the centuries is ample evidence of,180
d01-098-04.png,ok,this - and it was easily stored. It had two disadvantages. It,178

d01-104-06.png,ok,The other form of book was the codex. In this the,177

d01-118-00.png,ok,Against these advantages the codex was fragile and,156

d06-003-00.png,ok,Even worse is to laugh. Tremendous damage may be done to a child,155

d06-008-08.png,ok,it together until the child can see how,147
d06-008-09.png,ok,unnecessary its fears were.,148
d06-011-00.png,ok,Because situations which may contain,181
d06-011-01.png,ok,"all the elements of fear can arise suddenly,",182
d06-011-02.png,ok,it is a good idea to condition a child,180

d06-011-06.png,ok,"happens is not merely dishonest, it",179
d06-011-07.png,ok,is unwise. As I shall suggest in a,178
d06-011-08.png,ok,later chapter there are some situations,176
d06-011-09.png,ok,which occur less frequently than,176
d06-015-00.png,ok,"A little more honesty, even if one refrains from going into",188
d06-015-01.png,ok,"too many details, would help many a child to make a",187
d06-015-02.png,ok,proper adjustment to life as it grows up. Let us look,187
d06-015-03.png,ok,"at Jesus. We do not, I think, see there a life without fear.",186

d06-020-00.png,ok,In Gethsemane He prayed that the cup,148
d06-020-01.png,ok,should pass from Him. Jesus shows us,149
d06-020-02.png,ok,the way to face life. To see all the latent,150
d06-020-03.png,ok,frightening possibilities and yet by facing,149
d06-020-04.png,ok,them and knowing God is with us and,149
d06-020-05.png,ok,"that, with Him, there is nothing that can",150
d06-020-06.png,ok,"finally defeat us. More than that, that God",148
d06-020-07.png,ok,has something important to do with our,149
d06-020-08.png,ok,"lives and that the nearer we get to Him,",148

d06-030-01.png,ok,purely physical thing. The cure for which is sleep. This is only,187
d06-030-02.png,ok,partly true. Many people wake up tired of a morning and no,186
d06-030-03.png,ok,"amount of rest seems to make any difference. Sleep, to be",187
d06-030-04.png,ok,"effective, must be of that child-like quality which comes",185
d06-030-05.png,err,from innocence.,177
d06-037-00.png,ok,"To others, the long hours of the night bring",182
d06-037-01.png,ok,only a disturbed tossing and turning,181
d06-037-02.png,ok,which causes them to wake feeling worse,180
d06-037-03.png,ok,than when they went to bed. We may begin,179
d06-037-04.png,ok,to understand this a little better when we,178
d06-037-05.png,ok,realize that tiredness itself is largely in,180
d06-037-06.png,ok,"the mind. Very few people, under normal",177
d06-037-07.png,ok,"conditions, work themselves to a standstill.",177
d06-041-00.png,ok,The mind tires first and conveys the impression,165
d06-041-01.png,ok,of tiredness to the body. This can be proved by,166
d06-041-02.png,ok,noting the effect of a new stimulus on some-,165
d06-041-03.png,ok,body who feels thoroughly tired. Suppose,166
d06-041-04.png,ok,a mother has news late at night that her,163
d06-041-05.png,ok,child is in danger. She will undertake a,163
d06-041-06.png,ok,"journey which, an hour before, she would",164
d06-041-07.png,ok,have declared impossible.,164
d06-046-00.png,ok,"Even more simply, test your own reactions",146
d06-046-01.png,ok,to different situations. There are some which,146
d06-046-02.png,ok,bring on an almost immediate feeling of,146
d06-046-03.png,ok,tiredness - such as when your wife mentions,147
d06-046-04.png,err,"the washing-up - while others, if they",147
d06-046-05.png,ok,"refer to something you like doing, bring a",145
d06-046-06.png,ok,veritable surge of energy. Many a girl who,147
d06-046-07.png,err,is 'too tired to help mum' will later jump,147
d06-046-08.png,ok,up with no apparent tiredness at all when,145
d06-046-09.png,ok,her boy friend calls and go for a long walk.,148
d06-050-00.png,ok,Nor is she necessarily being deceitful. She really did feel tired,187
d06-050-01.png,ok,until the mind got the necessary injection of a fresh - and an,186
d06-050-02.png,ok,"attractive - interest! Tiredness has, therefore, as much to do",185
d06-050-03.png,ok,with our mental state as with our physical exhaustion. A,186
d06-050-04.png,ok,disturbed mind can bring the healthiest body to a sense,186
d06-050-05.png,ok,"of fatigue. They wonder why they get no rest at night,",184
d06-050-06.png,ok,even if they do sleep.,184
d06-056-00.png,err,They drag themselves around and can become,192
d06-056-01.png,ok,a burden to their families and their friends.,192
d06-056-02.png,ok,Any mental confusion can cause this and,191
d06-056-03.png,ok,the best way is probably to seek advice.,191
d06-056-04.png,ok,As we are unable to cure our own bodies,192
d06-056-05.png,ok,"if the cause of our pain is too deep seated,",191

d06-060-00.png,ok,One of the greatest steps forward that has been,163
d06-060-01.png,ok,made this century is the way in which illness,161

d06-060-03.png,ok,and is in fact no differently regarded than,163
d06-060-04.png,ok,"physical illness. There is, nevertheless, a",162
d06-060-05.png,ok,great deal of tiredness which comes from,162

e02-086-04.png,ok,any case may be regarded as a good beginning to,168
e02-086-05.png,ok,which other tools can be added as the need arises. The,168
e02-086-06.png,ok,nature of the work will probably dictate the additions,174
e02-086-07.png,ok,"to be made, but as a guide we have given a fuller kit",175

g04-077-00.png,ok,Very soon we managed to get a hut in Purley where soldiers,180
g04-077-01.png,ok,were very welcome and the ladies organized a canteen. Life was,183
g04-077-02.png,ok,in those years more than busy. We now had a vicarage next,180

g04-088-07.png,ok,largely based on this. It was on a,178
g04-088-08.png,ok,stamp which could be stuck in,175
g04-088-09.png,ok,"their book, and there was quite a",178
g04-088-10.png,ok,clamour for back stamps if a child,176
g04-088-11.png,err,had to miss the Sunday Church from any cause,174
g04-092-00.png,ok,It was quite amusing to see how much,179
g04-092-01.png,err,"the children enjoyed the service, and I heard",180

g04-092-04.png,err,allowed to come to the Children's Church,172
g04-092-05.png,err,on Sunday afternoon. I hope the threat,178
g04-092-06.png,err,"kept them good in the week, but anyway",178
g04-092-07.png,err,"they were a most delightful lot, and",179
g04-092-08.png,ok,it is a great joy to meet them now,179
g04-092-09.png,ok,fifty years afterwards when so many,177

g04-095-01.png,ok,me at once to chronicle a most intimate and,166
g04-095-02.png,ok,lasting friendship begun in 1913 in Purley and,167
g04-095-03.png,ok,continuing till old age to-day. When I went,167
g04-095-04.png,ok,"to St. Mark's, the first contact I made was",164

g04-098-00.png,ok,From then till now the acquaintance ripened into a very,171
g04-098-01.png,ok,deep friendship which I have taken with me through,165
g04-098-02.png,err,all the many vicissitudes of a long ministry. Mr. and,162
g04-098-03.png,ok,Mrs. Charlton have been from the first difficult,162

g04-104-00.png,ok,"In those early years 1914-18, life was very full",151

g04-104-02.png,ok,"The Bishop, knowing that I spent my holidays in",149

g04-104-08.png,ok,someone who knew their native villages.,148
g04-108-00.png,ok,I could at once notice the great antagonism,150
g04-108-01.png,ok,between the Bavarians and the Prussians who openly,150
g04-108-02.png,ok,scorned these more simple country folk.,149

k04-057-06.png,ok,with its underskirt of rose-brocade fitted her,187
k04-057-07.png,err,perfect figure. Vittoria's thoughts were more complex.,187
k04-061-00.png,ok,"The sparkling society of the Doria Palace, the flattery",187
k04-061-01.png,err,"of Orsini's obsession, the thwarted ambitions of her",188
k04-061-02.png,ok,"restless spirit, all threw into sharp relief the contrast",188
k04-061-03.png,ok,of her grey life with the splendid one that filled,189
k04-061-04.png,err,"her dreams. At the Villa Montalto she felt an alien,",186
k04-061-05.png,err,and although she had repeatedly urged Francesco,184
k04-061-06.png,ok,"to give her a separate establishment, he invariably",185
k04-061-07.png,ok,"pleaded his financial dependence on his uncle, who",184
k04-061-08.png,err,had built the villa for his family.,183
k04-064-00.png,ok,He reminded her that they must abide by Roman,176
k04-064-01.png,ok,"custom, and dwell there with their relations. Her",178
k04-064-02.png,ok,values were those of the materialist who assesses,175
k04-064-03.png,ok,"every human being in terms of fame, power and",174
k04-064-04.png,ok,"wealth. Francesco she despised for his dullness, his",174

k04-068-00.png,ok,"Her husband's gentleness and amiability, his unselfish",177
k04-068-01.png,ok,"love for her, she regarded as signs of weakness. He was a",176
k04-068-02.png,ok,futile creature who had not even proved capable of giving,176
k04-068-03.png,ok,her a child. Whatever passion she had experienced in the,174
k04-068-04.png,ok,first months of marriage had been ousted by contempt.,172
k04-068-05.png,ok,She had never loved him. Her thoughts rushed to Orsini.,175
k04-068-06.png,ok,"Since the meeting in the Doria Palace, no word had",175
k04-068-07.png,ok,"come from him, and this silence oppressed her spirits",174
k04-068-08.png,ok,with a weight of misgiving.,172
k04-075-00.png,ok,"She had, perhaps, demanded too much. The",184

k04-075-03.png,err,"if she yielded to him, her passion could,",182
k04-075-04.png,ok,"indeed, match his. Every instinct urged her to",180
k04-075-05.png,err,"surrender, for there was that in his nature",181
k04-075-06.png,ok,to which her own had responded as it,184

k04-079-02.png,err,dictate her course. There could be no,180
k04-079-03.png,ok,compromise. For a brief interval,182
k04-079-04.png,ok,she allowed herself the luxury of,180

k04-085-07.png,ok,shrieked Lucia. 'Banditti!',187

k04-093-06.png,ok,stared speechlessly at the golden bear; Vittoria swiftly,190

k04-103-02.png,ok,breaking of the aqueducts during the barbarian invasions,179
k04-103-03.png,ok,the baths had lost their purpose; they had become,180

k04-106-02.png,ok,gypsy encampment and a few tatterdemalion creatures,192
k04-106-03.png,ok,"gathered about it, cooking their frugal meal. These",192

k04-110-01.png,ok,Lucia might have been the only living,179
k04-110-02.png,ok,creatures on an empty planet. After the,180
k04-110-03.png,ok,"initial shock, Vittoria felt calm. She",179
k04-110-04.png,ok,"knew exactly what she wanted, and",177
k04-110-05.png,ok,"was prepared to take it without scruple,",179
k04-110-06.png,ok,if she could. What she had forgotten,179
k04-110-07.png,ok,in her self-absorption in her own schemes,180

k04-115-00.png,ok,This move today was a reminder of that fact.,186
k04-115-01.png,ok,Whilst she automatically patted the hand of,184

k04-115-04.png,err,"prepared to counter Orsini's demands,",182
k04-115-05.png,ok,difficult though that would be. She became,179
k04-115-06.png,ok,aware that the pace was slackening;,178
k04-115-07.png,err,now the coach stopped.,177
k04-119-00.png,ok,The moment had come. Upon the ensuing interview,191
k04-119-01.png,err,"the future would depend. Outwardly she was calm, but",190
k04-119-02.png,ok,"her heart was beating fast, and the palms of her",190
k04-119-03.png,ok,hands were damp. Orsini's high-crowned hat with,190
k04-119-04.png,ok,its jaunty plume blotted out the light; his hand,187
k04-119-05.png,err,was on the door. Glancing at Lucia he said in,185

k04-126-02.png,ok,"'I see. I know how to deal with people like that,'",174
k04-126-03.png,ok,"and turning to the cowering Lucia, he spoke in her",176
k04-126-04.png,err,"own language. 'Do you know who I am?' 'No,",174
k04-126-05.png,err,"signor,' she whispered. 'I am the Orsini. My word is",174
k04-126-06.png,err,law in Rome.',172
k04-136-00.png,ok,Lucia was regarding him as a rabbit looks at a stoat.,175
k04-136-01.png,ok,"Thrusting his head farther into the coach, he said",176
k04-136-02.png,ok,sombrely: 'Have you ever heard of a punishment called,175
k04-136-03.png,err,the cord?' She blanched and shrank away. Was there not,174
k04-136-04.png,err,a street near Sant' Angelo called the Lane of the Corda,175
k04-136-05.png,err,"where criminals were hoisted by their wrists forty, fifty,",173
k04-136-06.png,err,"sixty feet into the air, and dropped again and again, until",174
k04-136-07.png,err,their arms were wrenched from their sockets. 'You have,174

k04-142-00.png,ok,The Orsini give that to traitors. There is,175
k04-142-01.png,ok,no escaping the vengeance of an Orsini. We hunt,170
k04-142-02.png,ok,"a traitor down to the ends of the earth, and no",168
k04-142-03.png,ok,power can save him ... or her. Do you understand?',168
k04-142-04.png,err,"'Yes, signor,' she faltered. 'On the other hand,' he",168
k04-142-05.png,ok,"continued, giving her a keen look, 'the Orsini are",167
k04-142-06.png,ok,generous to those who serve them faithfully.,164
k04-149-00.png,err,"Remember that, my girl.' Lucia was beyond",166

k04-149-02.png,ok,with flushed cheeks and eyes sparkling with,164

k04-149-04.png,err,continue the conversation started at the Doria,163
k04-149-05.png,err,"Palace. Be pleased to alight.' 'I think,' she replied",162
k04-149-06.png,err,"coolly, 'I prefer to stay where I am.'",163
k04-156-00.png,err,"'In that case,' he reverted to French, 'I shall be obliged",177
k04-156-01.png,err,"to lift you from the coach.' Without answering him, she",179
k04-156-02.png,err,"rose, and bending over the agitated girl, said softly:",179
k04-156-03.png,err,"'No one will harm you, Lucia. Remain here.' Ignoring his",179
k04-156-04.png,err,"proffered hand, she stepped from the vehicle. 'Will you",180
k04-156-05.png,ok,be so good as to order your men not to molest my,180
k04-156-06.png,err,"maid,' she said coldly to Orsini.",184
k04-163-00.png,err,"'She is absolutely safe,' he replied; but he turned,",179
k04-163-01.png,ok,"nevertheless, to the man who had peered into the",179
k04-163-02.png,ok,"coach, whom he had addressed as Luigi, and gave him sharp",179
k04-163-03.png,ok,"instructions on the matter. Vittoria stood looking about her,",178
k04-163-04.png,ok,breathing the scent of thyme. The land at her feet sloped,177
k04-163-05.png,ok,"away into a tiny valley beyond which, on the crest",180
k04-163-06.png,ok,"of a wooded hill-side, the ruins of a small temple",184
k04-163-07.png,ok,were etched against the clear blue of the sky.,177
k07-059a-00.png,ok,"He forgot time and place. He, the master, was gently",179
k07-059a-01.png,ok,"led along erotic paths which he knew existed, but",179
k07-059a-02.png,ok,had never trodden. He learned how to use his,180
k07-059a-03.png,ok,"hands, how to adore that body without haste, how",181
k07-059a-04.png,ok,"to caress every inch with his mouth as well, to",179
k07-059a-05.png,ok,creep down along her smooth muscles till he lost,175
k07-059a-06.png,ok,himself in a rapture of kisses in places he'd,177
k07-059a-07.png,ok,"dreamed of, where life began to ooze and quickened",177
k07-059a-08.png,ok,his heart beat to a thunder.,175
k07-063a-00.png,ok,"He looked at her. Head thrown back in a pool of hair,",179
k07-063a-01.png,ok,her blood-red lips parted and the beating of her,181
k07-063a-02.png,ok,heart in the full throat. Her mouth did things he,178
k07-063a-03.png,ok,thought no human being could stand without,181
k07-063a-04.png,ok,"dying, but he went on living in an ocean of",178
k07-063a-05.png,ok,"voluptuousness, that swelled and ebbed over him,",174
k07-063a-06.png,ok,"under him, in him and through him...",176
k07-067a-00.png,ok,He was having a ball! He twiddled the TV set with,180
k07-067a-01.png,ok,shaking hands. She sat calmly on the bed smoking,177
k07-067a-02.png,ok,a cigarette. His face was white with two red,177
k07-067a-03.png,err,blotches. Hers was flushed and lovely. O.K. teacher!,178
k07-067a-04.png,ok,Was that any better? You know it was! You don't,178
k07-067a-05.png,ok,"need teaching, only a little coaxing.",174
k07-077-00.png,ok,He sat down and ran his finger down along her,180
k07-077-01.png,ok,spine. Do you love me now? Like yesterday! I'm,180
k07-077-02.png,err,extremely fond of you. The fact that you're beginning,176
k07-077-03.png,ok,to satisfy my physical wants does not change that.,180
k07-077-04.png,ok,Before long you'll give me the satisfaction that'll set,180
k07-077-05.png,ok,"me rocking on my feet, but I'll still be only fond of",176
k07-077-06.png,ok,you. But you wouldn't marry me?,176
k07-085-00.png,ok,No. I'm not your type. I'd make you miserable. I,180
k07-085-01.png,ok,mean that. I'd very probably be unfaithful and,180
k07-085-02.png,ok,"that'd kill you. Then I'd be unfaithful too, to teach",180
k07-085-03.png,err,you a lesson. It wouldn't work. You'd do it to,180
k07-085-04.png,ok,spite me. I would never do it for that reason.,180
k07-085-05.png,ok,To me it'd be immaterial whether you'd retaliate,176
k07-085-06.png,ok,or not. You'd go crazy if that situation arose.,180
k07-122-00.png,ok,To observe the colour rise in her cheek,183
k07-122-01.png,ok,"and hear her breath come faster, to see",187
k07-122-02.png,ok,the slight beads of sweat come out on,182
k07-122-03.png,ok,her glistening skin and see her move,180
k07-122-04.png,ok,with uncontrolled rhythm. To have her twist,180
k07-122-05.png,ok,in an attempt to receive a caress he was,180
k07-122-06.png,ok,"purposely withholding, to hear her deep-throated",176
k07-122-07.png,ok,moan of full satisfaction and feel her,176
k07-122-08.png,ok,"shivering, clawing surrender.",176
k07-125-00.png,ok,"Not so dusty, she might say afterwards, drawing at",182
k07-125-01.png,ok,a cigarette. It's a wow! he said. She kissed,187
k07-125-02.png,ok,him motherly: You just wait till you teach the,180
k07-125-03.png,ok,girl you really love. He didn't protest any more,180
k07-125-04.png,ok,to say he loved her because he knew it to,176
k07-125-05.png,ok,be untrue. Instead he said: Will that be,176
k07-125-06.png,ok,better? She nodded:,176
k07-134-00.png,ok,It's man's nature to teach and to teach those,181
k07-134-01.png,ok,we love is double pleasure. And she,177
k07-134-02.png,err,might add: And don't forget to leave the,181
k07-134-03.png,ok,lights on. You lose half the fun when you,181
k07-134-04.png,ok,fumble in the dark. She had many direct,181
k07-134-05.png,ok,comments like that. Once she quietly,177
k07-134-06.png,ok,pushed him back when he kissed her too,177
k07-134-07.png,ok,fully and too soon:,181
k07-141-00.png,ok,"Oi, not yet, you oaf. What do you think my",180
k07-141-01.png,ok,mouth is? A billposter's bucket to be,187
k07-141-02.png,ok,plunged in at random? He'd learned to,180
k07-141-03.png,ok,laugh when something went wrong or the,180
k07-141-04.png,ok,"situation became ludicrous, as when they",180
k07-141-05.png,ok,were both caught in the raw when he'd,180
k07-141-06.png,ok,forgotten to lock his door and Derek,173
k07-141-07.png,ok,had walked in unexpectedly.,180
k07-146-00.png,ok,They'd just had time to nip into the,180
k07-146-01.png,ok,bathroom and stood there shivering for,180
k07-146-02.png,ok,fifteen minutes while their guest was,180
k07-146-03.png,ok,smoking a cigarette waiting for him.,176
k07-146-04.png,ok,At last Derek got tired and left.,176
k07-146-05.png,ok,"Just in time, erupted Charlie. If he'd",176
k07-146-06.png,ok,stayed any longer I'd jolly well,173
k07-146-07.png,ok,have asked him to join us. I'm so,180
k07-146-08.png,ok,darned cold I could do with two men.,176
k07-152-00.png,ok,"You perverted sex-maniac, you wouldn't",182
k07-152-01.png,ok,dare. Show me what you can do and,182
k07-152-02.png,ok,I'll tell you if you need help.,179
k07-152-03.png,ok,Once he came back to the subject,182
k07-152-04.png,ok,of her marriage and asked her why,179
k07-152-05.png,ok,she was going to marry her sculptor.,179
k07-152-06.png,ok,"Because I love him, of course.",179
k07-152-07.png,ok,What do you think?,179
k07-158-00.png,err,"But he's a lot older, isn't he?",186
k07-158-01.png,ok,I suppose so. What attracts you?,182
k07-158-02.png,ok,It can't be physical? Of course,179
k07-158-03.png,ok,not! I love him for what he is,186
k07-158-04.png,ok,- he's so great I'm a bit scared,182
k07-158-05.png,ok,of him - a woman must be a bit,179
k07-158-06.png,ok,scared to be really in love.,179
k07-158-07.png,ok,That's why you could never,175
k07-158-08.png,ok,love me?,175
k07-166-00.png,ok,"Correct, ducky! You just wait till",182
k07-166-01.png,err,you meet the girl who thinks you're a,180
k07-166-02.png,ok,god. It'll make you feel like one!,180
k07-166-03.png,ok,You think that sculptor's a god?,180
k07-166-04.png,ok,"Perhaps, in a way. All I know is",180
k07-166-05.png,err,that I need him. He kissed the,176
k07-166-06.png,ok,heart beat in her throat. But how,176
k07-166-07.png,ok,about the physical side? You're,176
k07-166-08.png,ok,quite an erotic little beast; can,173
k07-166-09.png,ok,he satisfy that?,169

m01-012-02.png,ok,by degrees the rotating objects,188
m01-012-03.png,ok,"slowed, and coming into focus took",189
m01-012-04.png,ok,the form of the furnishings in Dan,185

m01-022-00.png,ok,"His usually animated face was expressionless and looked flat,",191
m01-022-01.png,ok,as though his nose had been pushed back and his eyes and cheeks,190
m01-022-02.png,ok,"brought forward. He mouthed a low mutter, punctuated at intervals",187
m01-022-03.png,ok,with a few syllables of a crazy and incoherent jargon. As,189

m01-026-02.png,ok,"shaken, Steve drew a glass of water and went back to",180

m01-026-07.png,ok,each other through forced association.,178
m01-032-00.png,ok,Then something like a zest for living began to come back,181
m01-032-01.png,ok,to Steve and he squeezed her hand. Her face took on,180
m01-032-02.png,ok,enough animation to produce a wan smile. Dan's low mut-,181
m01-032-03.png,ok,tering was just audible from the kitchen. And Steve,181
m01-032-04.png,ok,could see that as Heather recovered her senses and emotions,177
m01-032-05.png,ok,she was growing cold and numb with shock. She had seen,180
m01-032-06.png,ok,"Dan, or rather the physical relic of him - the empty",182

m01-038-00.png,ok,"And these had been his great qualities,",159

m01-038-05.png,err,eastward like a knife-edged twilight in,155

m01-038-07.png,ok,"First Stage in the Thetan pattern of conquest,",155
m01-038-08.png,ok,the empty-minded receptiveness that,153
m01-038-09.png,ok,prepared the way for the Second Stage.,155
m01-049-00.png,ok,He rose from his breakfast-nook bench,186
m01-049-01.png,ok,"and came into the livingroom, where",187
m01-049-02.png,ok,Heather and Steve stood aghast at,188

m01-049-05.png,ok,"thrust out, arms dangling loosely.",185
m01-049-06.png,ok,"Then, abruptly, he drew himself up",185
m01-049-07.png,ok,and walked on the very tips of,187

m01-049-09.png,err,"over his head and yawned agape,",184
m01-049-10.png,ok,drawing-in great breaths that,187

m01-060-06.png,ok,upward and shook his head slowly from,183
m01-060-07.png,ok,side to side.,185
m01-079-00.png,ok,A superfluous precaution for there was no other car,203
m01-079-01.png,ok,abroad; and no pedestrian to cross his path nor to wait,203
m01-079-02.png,ok,at an intersection for the light to change. At his,203
m01-079-03.png,ok,apartment he garaged his car and then stood,191
m01-079-04.png,err,listening in the night. Listening in vain. For the,191
m01-079-05.png,err,"earth had lost its life-tempo, as the heart",191

m01-084-03.png,ok,The set lighted-up but gave only a low,177
m01-084-04.png,ok,buzzing sound. He had just finished,176
m01-084-05.png,ok,"shaving when it came on, with a flat",174
m01-084-06.png,ok,"voice repeating: ""This is BBC calling",176

m01-090-00.png,ok,"After what seemed an undue period of repetition, the voice",194
m01-090-01.png,ok,went on to describe the landing of the Thetan colony,193
m01-090-02.png,ok,"in Sussex, in all its obscene details. Then the radio",192
m01-090-03.png,ok,"went dead again, and Steve had no stomach for",192
m01-090-04.png,ok,"breakfast. It was a beautiful day, as firsts-of-June",190
m01-090-05.png,ok,should be. Steve got out the car and traversed the,191
m01-090-06.png,ok,"same empty streets as he had the night before,",188
m01-090-07.png,ok,to keep an appointment with Heather.,189
m01-095-00.png,ok,Coming around the great mass of the Chateau,178
m01-095-01.png,ok,"Laurier, he braked to a screeching stop. A",179
m01-095-02.png,ok,flying saucer was tilting and dipping over,178
m01-095-03.png,ok,the War Memorial. There was a deep,179
m01-095-04.png,err,"whirring sound, and a high-pitched hissing",177
m01-095-05.png,ok,overtone that sang in his ears with an,175
m01-095-06.png,ok,almost painful sharpness. He reversed and,178
m01-095-07.png,ok,turned back on McKenzie Avenue.,178
m01-100-00.png,ok,The Thetans must not see him! He took another route,181
m01-100-01.png,ok,to Heather's and saw two more flying saucers on,185
m01-100-02.png,ok,the way. Heather was very anxious to visit Dan at,186
m01-100-03.png,ok,once; but Steve insisted that they should first discuss,187
m01-100-04.png,ok,"their situation, as far as it could be assessed,",185
m01-100-05.png,ok,and to decide on what seemed to be the best,182

m01-104-02.png,ok,people - who are probably falling all over them-,192
m01-104-03.png,ok,selves in their zeal to get their orders and to carry,194
m01-104-04.png,ok,"them out. Just what these orders will be, we don't",190
m01-104-05.png,ok,"know. Now, because of prior hypnosis we have es-",186
m01-104-06.png,ok,caped Thetan subjugation. This time. But we no,192
m01-104-07.png,ok,longer have any immunity.,195
m01-110-00.png,ok,There can be little doubt that if the,157
m01-110-01.png,ok,Thetans discover our mental independence,156
m01-110-02.png,ok,they will promptly give us their hypnotic,157
m01-110-03.png,ok,treatment. If we can avoid undue,159
m01-110-04.png,ok,"prominence, it may be that we can",159
m01-110-05.png,ok,move about pretty freely without,155
m01-110-06.png,ok,"detection. If we can - well, then we",157
m01-110-07.png,err,may be able to promote our own,156

m01-110-10.png,ok,"I haven't a clue; but, who knows,",159
m01-110-11.png,err,we may form the nucleus around ...,158
m01-115-00.png,ok,"""Now, to summarize what I think our",171
m01-115-01.png,ok,"course of action should be. First, to avoid the",171
m01-115-02.png,ok,"Thetans like the plague, for they must not",170
m01-115-03.png,ok,"find us out! Second, to tread pretty warily",170
m01-115-04.png,ok,"among our own people, finding out just how",171
m01-115-05.png,ok,much freedom we can take with safety.,168
m01-115-06.png,ok,"And third, to study these damned Thetans.",166
m01-115-07.png,ok,We must learn all we can about,170
m01-115-08.png,ok,them.,166
m01-121-00.png,ok,There is just a hope that we may uncover,196
m01-121-01.png,ok,"some weakness, and find a way of fighting",196
m01-121-02.png,ok,"back at them."" Heather agreed, and suggested",197
m01-121-03.png,ok,that they use Dan as a specimen demonstra-,197
m01-121-04.png,ok,ting how the Thetan machinations had been,196
m01-121-05.png,ok,working out. It occurred to Steve that this may,194
m01-121-06.png,ok,not have been entirely an objective suggestion,198
m01-121-07.png,ok,on her part; but he thought it a good idea,196
m01-121-08.png,err,nevertheless.,194
m01-125-00.png,ok,So they proceeded to see if the coast,170
m01-125-01.png,ok,was clear. The street was quiet and,170
m01-125-02.png,err,"deserted, and there were neither sight",168
m01-125-03.png,ok,nor sound of flying saucers. So they,171
m01-125-04.png,ok,ventured forth and made their way on,169
m01-125-05.png,ok,foot to Dan's house. Dan came,167
m01-125-06.png,ok,to the door at their ring but neglected,166
m01-125-07.png,ok,to offer any greeting. He was deeply,170
m01-125-08.png,ok,"preoccupied, and it seemed that the",171
m01-125-09.png,ok,ringing of a doorbell was to him,169
m01-125-10.png,ok,a new and strange phenomenon.,169
m01-131-00.png,ok,"When he finally beckoned to them to enter, the action",161
m01-131-01.png,ok,gave the impression of having been thought out and,161
m01-131-02.png,err,"decided upon. Inside they sat down unbidden, while",160
m01-131-03.png,err,Dan paced the floor. He seemed completely unaware,161
m01-131-04.png,err,"of their presence. They just stared at him, turning",163
m01-131-05.png,ok,their heads like tennis spectators as he walked up and,163
m01-131-06.png,ok,"down, up and down.",159
m01-136-00.png,ok,His whole attitude was a mixture of,176
m01-136-01.png,ok,impatience pending an awaited,178
m01-136-02.png,ok,communication and of a vague,177
m01-136-03.png,ok,perplexity respecting his surroundings,174
m01-136-04.png,ok,and the purpose he was to serve.,172
m01-136-05.png,err,"Finally, being so obviously on their own,",175
m01-136-06.png,ok,Heather and Steve tried to make themselves,174
m01-136-07.png,ok,at home. Steve switched on Dan's,175
m01-136-08.png,ok,"powerful, world-wide radio and systematically",175
m01-136-09.png,ok,turned the tuning knob through all the,172
m01-136-10.png,err,tuning points of the world's great radio,171
m01-149-00.png,ok,"They followed him to a city bus stop on Carling Avenue, where",190
m01-149-01.png,ok,he waited. The bus stop was a deserted island on an empty street.,189
m01-149-02.png,ok,"But not for long, for soon pedestrians and cars flocked upon",189

m01-160-01.png,ok,"followed the beaming Dan aboard, taking",183
m01-160-02.png,ok,seats some rows behind him. Steve was,181
m01-160-03.png,ok,"beginning to find the stereotyped, flattish, happy",184
m01-160-04.png,ok,faces very disconcerting; and looking at,183
m01-160-05.png,ok,Heather he found a welcome relief in her,178
m01-160-06.png,ok,relatively long doleful one,184

n01-000-02.png,ok,which must necessarily be subordinated to his,191
n01-000-03.png,ok,career. Now he realised that he was entrusting not only,190

n01-020-00.png,ok,For some reason the orderlies had forgotten,172
n01-020-01.png,ok,to switch on the lights; there was no colour -,172
n01-020-02.png,ok,physical features were distinguishable solely by,172
n01-020-03.png,ok,gradations of silvery greyness. Even the snow-,173

n01-031-01.png,ok,make a direct comparison between the radar,170

n01-036-01.png,ok,"naked eye, obscured by the ground haze which even",194
n01-036-02.png,ok,on the clearest night limited angular vision. He glanced,191
n01-036-03.png,ok,at the speed recorder. It seemed almost incredible that,190
n01-036-04.png,ok,the tiny white figure of 8.5 against which the needle,187

n01-057-00.png,ok,Geoffrey set himself to consider the,179

n01-057-03.png,ok,Tartaro at a few minutes past ten on the,178

n01-057-05.png,ok,on the presumption that its route had been,175
n01-057-06.png,ok,through Florence and Rome and then,176
n01-057-07.png,ok,across Italy via Foggia to Barletta.,178
n01-057-08.png,ok,It came to just over six hundred,175

n02-004-00.png,ok,"To Beryl, at least, this was anti-climax with a",164
