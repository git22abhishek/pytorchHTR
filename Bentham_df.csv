071_053_003_03_05,ly are the incidents from which such opportu=,45

071_053_003_03_08,to appoint an extrao dinary punishment which could ap=,54
071_053_003_03_09,=ply in but a small proportion of the cases in which there,58
071_053_003_03_11,was a demand for it . The benefit produced by an extrao dinary,62
071_053_003_03_12,provision for that purpose would hardly make up for the incon-,62
071_053_003_03_13,-venience that might result from the addition such a provision,62
071_053_003_03_15,it would make to the  voluminuousness  and intricacy of the,59
071_053_003_03_16,penal code :  such a provision would hardly pay for its place in,64
071_053_003_03_17,the catalogue of punishments .,30
071_053_003_03_18,3 . Another reason against applying extraodinary punishment,59
071_053_003_03_19,in the case of domestic theft is their being subject to a,57
071_053_003_03_21,check to which either strangers are not exposed . The most,58
071_053_003_03_23,valuable possession a stranger has is his character this,56
071_053_003_03_24,character is his great trust and dependence and support,55
071_053_004_03_01,Theft Embezzlement and Fraudulent Obtainment,44
071_053_004_03_02,the basis of the highest fortune a servant can ordinarily,57
071_053_004_03_03,possess to himself a good place or succession of good places,60
071_053_004_03_05,Now this possession as everybody knows and as the servant,57
071_053_004_03_07,must he would be deprived by any act of delinquency of,54
071_053_004_03_08,any of the kinds now under consideration . Now the more,55
071_053_004_03_10,powerfully a man is acted upon in direction by other,52
071_053_004_03_11,powers with the less force is it necessary to act upon,54
071_053_004_03_12,him in the way of punishment,28
071_053_004_03_13,4 :  But the most forcible objection of all seems to be,55
071_053_004_03_14,that if an extraodinary punishment were appointed in,52
071_053_004_03_15,this case the greater it were the less likely it would,54
071_053_004_03_16,be to be put in execution from whence it would become,53
071_053_004_03_17,the less formidable and efficatious . At any rate a,51

071_054_001_03_07,have frequent occasions to converse & they become habituated,60
071_054_001_03_08,to each other :  a look of plaintive reproach from a servant,60

071_054_001_03_13,the like circumstances . A servant is much more likely,54
071_054_001_03_14,to find advocates and intercessors among the friends and,56
071_054_001_03_15,relations of the family .,25
071_054_001_03_16,Another thing is that people at large fail not to take,54

071_054_001_03_22,All these considerations make it more difficult to get,54

071_181_004_04_02,:pon the same footing.,22
071_181_004_04_04,At first sight it may appear hard that a fraud upon,51
071_181_004_04_05,an Article of so small a value as the Copper Coin should be,59
071_181_004_04_06,punished as severely as a fraud upon one of so high a value,59
071_181_004_04_07,"as the Silver or even the Gold Coin, since the profit that",58
071_181_004_04_08,may be made by the falsifying any piece of the less precious,60
071_181_004_04_09,metal is not near so great as that which may be made,52
071_181_004_04_10,by the falsifying of the more precious metal. But the case,58
071_181_004_04_11,here is that the mischief is not to be estimated from the ef=,61
071_181_004_04_12,:fects of a single Act but from the effects of the Habit. Now,61
071_181_004_04_13,when the Habit is taken into the Account the one practice,57
071_181_004_04_14,does not seem to demand in any considerable degree a great=,59
071_181_004_04_15,:er punishment than the other. Where the profit upon a,54
071_181_004_04_16,"single piece is the greatest, the difficulty of getting it off is",65
071_181_004_04_17,"the greatest. The profit upon a base shilling may, it is",56

071_182_001_04_02,off a base Shilling may be Twenty four times as great  ( or,59
071_182_001_04_03,perhaps more )  as the difficulty of getting off a bad half-pen=,64

071_182_001_05_10,Coin is of course examined with much more attention than a,58
071_182_001_05_11,piece of Silver coin :  as a piece of Silver Coin is with more,62
071_182_001_05_12,attention than a piece of Copper Coin . In England especially since,67
071_182_001_05_13,the reformation of the Gold Coin a man seldom takes a Guinea,60
071_182_001_05_14,or a half Guinea of a stranger without weighing it ; but a man,62

071_182_002_04_05,a bad half penny is as great as that of uttering a bad guinea ;,63
071_182_002_04_06,and the secondary mischief would be in the same proportion ; as,63
071_182_002_04_07,both the danger and the apprehension of taking bad half pence,61

072_050_003_04_08,are likely to come in the offender's way. An act of Piracy is,61
072_050_003_04_09,therefore commonly looked upon as an act of hostility against,61
072_050_003_04_10,mankind in general . The least therefore which is expected,58
072_050_003_04_11,from the State of which the Pirate is a member is that,54
072_050_003_04_12,it should acquiesce in his being punished : If it happens,57
072_050_003_04_13,to have any particular means in its hands of punishing,54

072_051_002_04_06,to prejudice a foreign state in any other manner . It is,56

115_086_003_02_29,to be to the number of persons living at the commencement,57

115_107_001_01_09,or possibility of evasion .,27
115_107_001_01_10,The nature of things does not afford another expedient,54
115_107_001_01_11,of equal efficacy for effecting that intimacy of union between,62

115_107_001_01_14,sole and universally acknowledged of the miseries and,53
115_107_001_01_15,abuses which have been so notoriously prevalent in prisons .,60
115_107_001_01_16,It applies to this purpose the united powers of,47
115_107_001_01_17,"reward and punishment , without the expence of the",50
115_107_001_01_18,one or the hardship of the other  :  at the same time,53

115_107_001_01_22,can ever be attended with . Legal penalties can attack only,59

115_107_002_01_05,proportionable multitude of complaints . Innocence,50

115_107_002_01_07,but against superficial prejudices & vague imputations,54

115_107_002_01_22,The same principle has lately been applied by,45

115_107_003_01_01,The date of Mr Bentham ' s Proposal of which the,48

115_107_003_01_03,to the application made of it in both those instances .,55
115_107_003_01_04,Seeing it universally approved and applauded in these,53
115_107_003_01_05,instances it would be matter of no small mortification,54
115_107_003_01_06,to him to find it rejected in an instance in which at,53
115_107_003_01_07,his own risk he has shewn so much anxiety to see it,51
115_107_003_01_08,introduced . Should the Inventor of this species of,51

115_107_003_01_10,valuable consideration a premium which so many,46
