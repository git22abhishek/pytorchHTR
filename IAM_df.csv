a04-043-03,ok,sites in Britain for the training of German,186
a04-043-04,ok,troops. His main theme was that nuclear,186
a04-043-05,ok,"weapons were necessary to defend Britain, that",186
a04-043-06,ok,"Britain must depend on Nato and ""the West""",186
a04-043-07,ok,must have nuclear weapons so long as the,186

a04-047-00,ok,Addressing the annual congress of the National Union,172
a04-047-01,ok,"of General and Municipal Workers, he said he felt",172
a04-047-02,ok,sure the Labour movement was coming round in,172
a04-047-03,ok,support of his views. Obviously conscious of the fierce and,172
a04-047-04,ok,widespread resentment over the U.S. Polaris base in,172
a04-047-05,ok,"Britain, Mr. Gaitskell said that he even noticed that",172
a04-047-06,ok,supporters of unilateral nuclear disarmament were changing,172
a04-047-07,ok,their tactics by switching most of their emphasis on,172
a04-047-08,ok,to the missile.,165
a04-050-00,ok,Mr Gaitskell said that a member of an alliance could,172
a04-050-01,ok,not deny facilities to nations to which it was,172
a04-050-02,ok,allied. But governments should be free to negotiate,172
a04-050-03,ok,and refuse proposals with which they did not,182
a04-050-04,ok,"agree. The Labour Party opposed Thor missiles, because,",172
a04-050-05,ok,"he said, they were out of date and vulnerable and",172
a04-050-06,ok,would attract enemy action.,172
a04-054-00,ok,That argument did not apply to the Polaris submarine.,172
a04-054-01,ok,"So long as the Soviet Union had nuclear weapons,",172
a04-054-02,ok,"the West, somewhere, must have them too. It",172
a04-054-03,ok,was far better for a weapon used for retaliatory,172
a04-054-04,ok,purposes to be under the sea rather than on land.,172
a04-054-05,ok,This was why the Labour Party did not think it right,172
a04-054-06,ok,to oppose the Polaris depot ship.,172
a04-059-00,ok,The party agreed that it was unwise to locate the base,182
a04-059-01,ok,"in the Holy Loch, only 30 miles from Glasgow, a",172
a04-059-02,ok,city with two million people. It should be sited,172
a04-059-03,ok,in a more remote area. Mr. Gaitskell added that,172
a04-059-04,ok,"the Scarborough conference decisions did not, in his",172
a04-059-05,ok,"view, truly reflect the opinions of the majority",172
a04-059-06,err,of party members and still less the party's,172
a04-059-07,ok,supporters in the country.,172
a04-066-00,ok,Mr Gaitskell added that agreement with the,203
a04-066-01,ok,"unilateralists was not possible, though",203
a04-066-02,ok,he respected their views. He saw by reports,203
a04-066-03,err,"that ""those who organise these things"" were",203
a04-066-04,ok,recommending the supporters of unilateral nuclear,203

a04-072-05,ok,was the beginning of a great period of,189
a04-072-06,ok,opportunity for the party. It was a,188
a04-072-07,ok,great chance that should be grasped.,188
a04-072-08,ok,Inter-union jealousies prevent the,203
a04-072-09,ok,fulfilment of a common policy for wages,203
a04-072-10,ok,"and other major questions, Mr. Jack Cooper",203
a04-081-00,ok,The General Council of the Trades Union,182
a04-081-01,ok,Congress should therefore consider the,182
a04-081-02,ok,matter. Consideration should also be given,182

a04-081-04,ok,modification of their structures to,182
a04-081-05,ok,meet the growing concentration of,172
a04-081-06,ok,capital. Mr. Cooper argued that a,172
a04-081-07,ok,common industrial contribution was,172
a04-081-08,ok,urgent - particularly in unions serving,172
a04-081-09,ok,workers in the same industry - along,172

a04-085-04,ok,BEFORE President Kennedy met Mr.,172
a04-085-05,ok,Macmillan yesterday morning he was given,172
a04-085-06,ok,the views of a wide section of the,172
a04-085-07,ok,British people about Polaris submarine,172
a04-085-08,ok,bases in this country. An open letter,172
a04-085-09,ok,written by Earl Russell hoping that the,172
a04-089-00,ok,"Earl Russell, President of the Committee",172
a04-089-01,ok,"of 100, told Kennedy that he should",172
a04-089-02,ok,"take notice of ""that very large and",172
a04-089-03,ok,growing section which is opposed to,172
a04-089-04,ok,"the establishment of a Polaris base,",172
a04-089-05,ok,whether at Holy Loch or elsewhere on,172
a04-089-06,ok,"British territory."" He pointed out that",172
a04-089-07,ok,already there have been protests but,172
a04-089-08,ok,"that ""very much larger protests are to",172
a04-089-09,ok,"be expected and are being planned.""",172
a04-092-00,ok,There are three kinds of reasons that justify,182
a04-092-01,ok,the protests and these should carry weight with,182
a04-092-02,ok,"the U.S. Government, Earl Russell suggested. ""The",182
a04-092-03,ok,first of these reasons is the importance of pre-,182
a04-092-04,ok,serving the hitherto cordial relations between the,182
a04-092-05,ok,"U.S. and Great Britain, not only in Government",182
a04-092-06,ok,"circles, but in public opinion."" Earl Russell",182
a04-092-07,ok,"says it is inevitable, though profoundly",182
a04-092-08,ok,"regrettable, that the agitation against",182
a04-092-09,ok,the Polaris base has generated some antagonism,182
a04-092-10,ok,to the policy of the United States.,182
a04-096-00,ok,The second reason is concerned with doubts,182
a04-096-01,ok,as to the safety of the people of Great Britain;,182
a04-096-02,ok,"""in the time of crisis it would probably be",182
a04-096-03,ok,impossible for the British authorities to,182
a04-096-04,ok,exercise any degree of control over the action,182
a04-096-05,ok,"of Polaris submarines."" He argues that",182
a04-096-06,ok,there is a distinct possibility that so long,182
a04-096-07,ok,as there is a Polaris base in Britain the,182
a04-096-08,ok,Soviet Union might retaliate against,182
a04-096-09,ok,Britain alone.,182
a04-099-00,ok,"""Such retaliation might, and probably would,",182
a04-099-01,ok,destroy the whole population of Britain in,182
a04-099-02,err,"the course of, at the most, an hour"" without",182
a04-099-03,ok,provoking American retaliation. Earl Russell,182
a04-099-04,ok,"believes: ""It is very questionable whether",182
a04-099-05,ok,British membership of Nato and British,182
a04-099-06,ok,permission of American bases on our territory,182
a04-099-07,ok,"add anything to the strength of America,",182
a04-099-08,ok,"while, on the contrary, they impose upon",182
a04-099-09,ok,America an onerous obligation which it,182
a04-099-10,ok,"may prove impossible to fulfil.""",182
a04-103-00,ok,The third reason is that the supreme,182
a04-103-01,ok,interest for the whole world - East and,182
a04-103-02,ok,West and uncommitted nations - is the,182
a04-103-03,ok,"prevention of nuclear war. ""A rapidly",182
a04-103-04,ok,growing body of opinion in this country,182
a04-103-05,ok,believes that Britain could be more effective,182
a04-103-06,ok,in preventing a nuclear war as a neutral,182
a04-103-07,ok,by helping to suggest agreements which could,182
a04-103-08,ok,"be accepted by both East and West.""",182
a05-000-00,ok,"THE next White Paper on defence, to",169

a05-000-02,ok,contain a five-year plan for the three,170

a05-004-02,ok,"Air Force would become, for practical purposes,",187
a05-004-03,ok,a single defence force. There would be,187
a05-004-04,ok,complete co-operation at all levels in training,183

a05-004-08,ok,"has been working on the plan for some months,",184
a05-004-09,err,with the Prime Minister's approval.,182
a05-009-00,ok,He has had numerous meetings with the Service,188

a05-009-03,ok,Ministers concerned with overseas aspects,189

a05-009-07,ok,or five months.,188
a05-013-00,err,The scheme will be subject to Cabinet,176
a05-013-01,ok,approval. Mr. Watkinson remains con-,176
a05-013-02,ok,vinced that the policy initiated in,175
a05-013-03,err,"1957, in Mr. Sandys's time as Minister",176
a05-013-04,err,"of Defence, is still correct. This was to",175

a05-013-07,ok,Serviceman out of uniform by the end,176
a05-013-08,ok,of 1962.,171
a05-017-00,ok,The Minister regards the recent trend,179
a05-017-01,ok,of recruiting figures as encouraging.,176
a05-017-02,ok,He is confident the aim can be achieved.,179
a05-017-03,ok,While the possibility of an eventual return,175
a05-017-04,ok,to National Service in some form,176
a05-017-05,ok,"cannot be entirely discounted, he does",173
a05-017-06,ok,not agree that the point has been reached,173
a05-017-07,err,where this need even be considered. If,175
a05-017-08,ok,"National Service is ever resorted to,",172
a05-017-09,ok,engagement would probably have to be for,173
a05-017-10,ok,three years.,173
a05-022-00,ok,It is thought this would be the minimum,174
a05-022-01,ok,necessary for the extended training modern,177
a05-022-02,ok,arms require and to enable each man to,176
a05-022-03,ok,serve at least a year overseas. There is,176
a05-022-04,ok,no truth in suggestions that Mr. Watkinson,174

a05-080-09,ok,hopeful.,174
a05-084-00,ok,The Russians now realised its seriousness. The,182
a05-084-01,ok,French doubts were more about procedure,184
a05-084-02,ok,than about substance. The Prime Minister's,184
a05-084-03,ok,attitude of studied calm brought down the,182

a05-104-00,ok,Mr. Healey denounced the Government for,187

a05-104-04,ok,they themselves had no condemnation for,185

a05-104-06,ok,"the Government, said Mr. Healey, to",181

d01-056-08,ok,it is not a matter of the greatest importance,188
d01-056-09,ok,which text is used.,183
d01-060-00,ok,At first sight the difference between,191
d01-060-01,ok,Souter and the other texts is rather,191
d01-060-02,ok,large. But the British text includes,190
d01-060-03,ok,"the paragraph 7.53-8.11, the Woman",188
d01-060-04,ok,"taken in Adultery, and this accounts",187
d01-060-05,ok,"for 178 words out of 279, which is",189
d01-060-06,ok,"the difference between the 15,695 words",191
d01-060-07,ok,"of Souter's text and the 15,416 of Nestle's.",189
d01-060-08,ok,The omission or inclusion of this paragraph,188
d01-060-09,ok,is a matter of editorial decision rather,189
d01-080-00,ok,"The bar was the commonest marking, but others",154
d01-080-01,ok,were also used. Dots sometimes served in place of the,153
d01-080-02,ok,"bar, and there are cases where spacing is used as",156
d01-080-03,ok,it is now used to mark a paragraph ending. Frequently,153
d01-080-04,ok,paragraphos markings were omitted. C. H. Roberts is of,152
d01-080-05,ok,the opinion that in the original of the Fourth Gospel,155
d01-080-06,ok,"some markings would be used, although which, it is",155
d01-080-07,ok,impossible to say.,151
d01-085-00,err,Professor E. G. Turner is inclined to take the view that,153
d01-085-01,ok,the original of the Gospel would be unmarked. The,154
d01-085-02,ok,"original of the Gospel, whether written on a roll or codex,",155
d01-085-03,ok,"whether paragraphed or not, would be laid out in",152
d01-085-04,ok,columns. This is the invariable practice of ancient,152
d01-085-05,ok,manuscripts. A common size of column would hold,155
d01-085-06,err,about one third of a page of Souter's print.,157
d01-098-00,ok,The edge of this sheet was attached to a wooden dowel,182
d01-098-01,err,and the sheet wound round this central pin. The roll made,181
d01-098-02,ok,a simple and serviceable book. It was robust - the number,180
d01-098-03,ok,which have survived the centuries is ample evidence of,180
d01-098-04,ok,this - and it was easily stored. It had two disadvantages. It,178
d01-098-05,ok,"was generally a single-sided form of book, and it was not",178
d01-098-06,err,an easy form of book in which to find a,179
d01-098-07,err,reference.,177
d01-104-00,ok,This last objection might have had some weight in,180
d01-104-01,ok,"ecclesiastical circles. In his Natural History, 13.11-12,",180
d01-104-02,ok,the elder Pliny tells of the use of papyrus in roll-making.,179
d01-104-03,ok,As Pliny was killed in the eruption of Vesuvius which,179
d01-104-04,ok,"overwhelmed Herculaneum and Pompeii in A.D. 79, his",177
d01-104-05,ok,information is contemporaneous with the New Testament.,177
d01-104-06,ok,The other form of book was the codex. In this the,177
d01-104-07,ok,sheets were bound together down one edge much as,180
d01-104-08,err,they are in modern books.,177
d01-118-00,ok,Against these advantages the codex was fragile and,156
d01-118-01,ok,might be bulky. It is sometimes possible to tell,157
d01-118-02,ok,whether or not a particular text was written on,156
d01-118-03,ok,a roll or a codex. Rolls were prepared for,157
d01-118-04,ok,"writing, but any papyrus left unused at the",154
d01-118-05,ok,end could be cut off. If the text was longer than,154
d01-118-06,ok,"the roll, a sheet could easily be glued on.",157
d01-123-00,ok,"The verso of the roll was blank, and one",191

d01-123-03,ok,while one whole side of his roll was unused.,190
d01-123-04,ok,The codex form was not so accommodating. Even,161
d01-123-05,ok,"in the case of the single-sheet quire, an extra",156

d05-013-06,err,remained. Other changes in the Book were equally,172
d05-013-07,err,minor except for the new section on the Sacraments,172

d05-021-00,ok,This indicated how ephemeral in the Church had,161

d05-025-04,ok,"Charles, in whose reign came the Scottish",167
d05-025-05,ok,Prayer Book in 1637. Significantly this made,165
d05-025-06,ok,a deliberate return to the Book of 1549 and,165

d05-030-03,ok,"by Calvinists and Puritans, and the sentiment was",168
d05-030-04,ok,mutual. But Laud was no Romanizer. One of his,166
d05-030-05,ok,first public acts was a hard-hitting battle with,166
d05-030-06,ok,"the Jesuit, Fisher. But anyone who was friendly",168
d05-030-07,ok,"with James and Charles, the Puritans argued,",166
d05-030-08,ok,was necessarily a menace.,163
d05-040-00,err,Or when he found cock-fighting going on in church?,186
d05-040-01,ok,Laud made a positive approach. He set out to increase,185
d05-040-02,ok,a sense of reverence. The Prayer Book was to be respected,185
d05-040-03,ok,and so was the office of a bishop. Altars should be,188
d05-040-04,ok,"altars and not any broken down, transportable",188
d05-040-05,ok,table which was handy for the most improbable uses.,185
d06-000-00,ok,In the first place it is not a great deal,182
d06-000-01,ok,"of use telling even children, as I have",182
d06-000-02,ok,"already suggested, not to be silly or",186
d06-000-03,ok,to pull themselves together. Far better,182
d06-000-04,ok,to help them to face whatever it is that,182
d06-000-05,ok,"is worrying them, to find the original",182
d06-000-06,ok,cause and then deal with it; show it,182
d06-000-07,ok,up either for the sham it is - and many,182
d06-000-08,ok,fears are based upon completely,182
d06-000-09,ok,irrational pre-conceived notions - or to,182
d06-003-00,ok,Even worse is to laugh. Tremendous damage may be done to a child,155
d06-003-01,ok,"by laughing at what are very real fears. As adults, we know",156
d06-003-02,ok,"that their fears are groundless, indeed to us they appear laughable,",155
d06-003-03,ok,but to a child they are very real. Not that I am suggesting,155
d06-003-04,ok,that children should be molly-coddled - they must be made,155
d06-003-05,ok,"to face their fears, to see through them and come out on the",156
d06-003-06,ok,other side as victors.,155
d06-008-00,ok,To ridicule them only pushes them farther,148
d06-008-01,ok,"into themselves, so that they become",149
d06-008-02,ok,unable to speak about it to anybody and,147
d06-008-03,ok,"the seeds of any amount of trouble are sown,",149
d06-008-04,ok,the harvest of which may still be being,148
d06-008-05,ok,reaped at forty or fifty. Far better to,147
d06-008-06,ok,agree with a child that a particular,149
d06-008-07,ok,"situation is frightening, and then to face",148
d06-008-08,ok,it together until the child can see how,147
d06-008-09,ok,unnecessary its fears were.,148
d06-011-00,ok,Because situations which may contain,181
d06-011-01,ok,"all the elements of fear can arise suddenly,",182
d06-011-02,ok,it is a good idea to condition a child,180
d06-011-03,ok,to some extent against it. To keep a child,179
d06-011-04,ok,of twelve or thirteen under the,178
d06-011-05,ok,impression that nothing nasty ever,180
d06-011-06,ok,"happens is not merely dishonest, it",179
d06-011-07,ok,is unwise. As I shall suggest in a,178
d06-011-08,ok,later chapter there are some situations,176
d06-011-09,ok,which occur less frequently than,176
d06-015-00,ok,"A little more honesty, even if one refrains from going into",188
d06-015-01,ok,"too many details, would help many a child to make a",187
d06-015-02,ok,proper adjustment to life as it grows up. Let us look,187
d06-015-03,ok,"at Jesus. We do not, I think, see there a life without fear.",186
d06-015-04,ok,There are several instances where he seemed unable to go,185
d06-015-05,ok,on.,182
d06-020-00,ok,In Gethsemane He prayed that the cup,148
d06-020-01,ok,should pass from Him. Jesus shows us,149
d06-020-02,ok,the way to face life. To see all the latent,150
d06-020-03,ok,frightening possibilities and yet by facing,149
d06-020-04,ok,them and knowing God is with us and,149
d06-020-05,ok,"that, with Him, there is nothing that can",150
d06-020-06,ok,"finally defeat us. More than that, that God",148
d06-020-07,ok,has something important to do with our,149
d06-020-08,ok,"lives and that the nearer we get to Him,",148
d06-020-09,ok,the stronger we become.,148
d06-025-00,err,...Today A wonderful thought In the,174
d06-025-01,err,dawn was given... And the thought,173

d06-027-03,ok,"be really afraid, help us to know that when",191
d06-027-04,ok,"we face life boldly, many of the shadows are",190
d06-027-05,err,"seen to be allies and not enemies and that,",189
d06-027-06,ok,"come what may, we are never alone when",189
d06-027-07,ok,we are with Thee.,189
d06-030-00,ok,Amen. MOST people would probably regard tiredness as a,186
d06-030-01,ok,purely physical thing. The cure for which is sleep. This is only,187
d06-030-02,ok,partly true. Many people wake up tired of a morning and no,186
d06-030-03,ok,"amount of rest seems to make any difference. Sleep, to be",187
d06-030-04,ok,"effective, must be of that child-like quality which comes",185
d06-030-05,err,from innocence.,177
d06-037-00,ok,"To others, the long hours of the night bring",182
d06-037-01,ok,only a disturbed tossing and turning,181
d06-037-02,ok,which causes them to wake feeling worse,180
d06-037-03,ok,than when they went to bed. We may begin,179
d06-037-04,ok,to understand this a little better when we,178
d06-037-05,ok,realize that tiredness itself is largely in,180
d06-037-06,ok,"the mind. Very few people, under normal",177
d06-037-07,ok,"conditions, work themselves to a standstill.",177
d06-041-00,ok,The mind tires first and conveys the impression,165
d06-041-01,ok,of tiredness to the body. This can be proved by,166
d06-041-02,ok,noting the effect of a new stimulus on some-,165
d06-041-03,ok,body who feels thoroughly tired. Suppose,166
d06-041-04,ok,a mother has news late at night that her,163
d06-041-05,ok,child is in danger. She will undertake a,163
d06-041-06,ok,"journey which, an hour before, she would",164
d06-041-07,ok,have declared impossible.,164
d06-046-00,ok,"Even more simply, test your own reactions",146
d06-046-01,ok,to different situations. There are some which,146
d06-046-02,ok,bring on an almost immediate feeling of,146
d06-046-03,ok,tiredness - such as when your wife mentions,147
d06-046-04,err,"the washing-up - while others, if they",147
d06-046-05,ok,"refer to something you like doing, bring a",145
d06-046-06,ok,veritable surge of energy. Many a girl who,147
d06-046-07,err,is 'too tired to help mum' will later jump,147
d06-046-08,ok,up with no apparent tiredness at all when,145
d06-046-09,ok,her boy friend calls and go for a long walk.,148
d06-050-00,ok,Nor is she necessarily being deceitful. She really did feel tired,187
d06-050-01,ok,until the mind got the necessary injection of a fresh - and an,186
d06-050-02,ok,"attractive - interest! Tiredness has, therefore, as much to do",185
d06-050-03,ok,with our mental state as with our physical exhaustion. A,186
d06-050-04,ok,disturbed mind can bring the healthiest body to a sense,186
d06-050-05,ok,"of fatigue. They wonder why they get no rest at night,",184
d06-050-06,ok,even if they do sleep.,184
d06-056-00,err,They drag themselves around and can become,192
d06-056-01,ok,a burden to their families and their friends.,192
d06-056-02,ok,Any mental confusion can cause this and,191
d06-056-03,ok,the best way is probably to seek advice.,191
d06-056-04,ok,As we are unable to cure our own bodies,192
d06-056-05,ok,"if the cause of our pain is too deep seated,",191
d06-056-06,ok,"so we are unable to cure our own minds,",190
d06-056-07,err,if the trouble is a complicated one,191
d06-056-08,ok,involving careful and patient treatment.,191
d06-060-00,ok,One of the greatest steps forward that has been,163
d06-060-01,ok,made this century is the way in which illness,161
d06-060-02,ok,"of the mind is no longer feared or shunned,",164
d06-060-03,ok,and is in fact no differently regarded than,163
d06-060-04,ok,"physical illness. There is, nevertheless, a",162
d06-060-05,ok,great deal of tiredness which comes from,162
d06-060-06,ok,no major complication but results from an,160
d06-060-07,ok,"inability to deal with life, especially under",161
d06-060-08,ok,the diverse pattern which is the twentieth,158
d06-060-09,ok,century.,158
d06-063-00,ok,"In the days when most people were born,",145
d06-063-01,ok,lived and died within the boundaries of,145
d06-063-02,ok,"the village, it was not difficult for anybody",146
d06-063-03,ok,to live a day at a time. Even those who,146
d06-063-04,ok,held a high and responsible office lived in,146
d06-063-05,ok,far greater simplicity than their successors.,146
d06-063-06,ok,"When news from the Continent took days,",147
d06-063-07,ok,"from America weeks, from the Far East,",145
d06-063-08,ok,"months, even a Prime Minister could go to",146
d06-063-09,ok,sleep in blissful ignorance of what might,146
d06-063-10,err,"be happening at the other end of England,",145
d06-067-00,err,"In other ways, too, life for the ordinary",176
d06-067-01,ok,individual has become so complex,174
d06-067-02,ok,that it taxes the mind. Two hundred,174
d06-067-03,err,"years ago, men lived and worked",175
d06-067-04,err,"in one place, their lives were of one",175
d06-067-05,ok,"piece. Now a man may live twenty,",173
d06-067-06,ok,thirty even sixty miles from his,174
d06-067-07,ok,work. The only connexion is the,174
d06-067-08,ok,pipeline of the railway on which they,173
d06-067-09,ok,travel day by day.,171
d06-072-00,err,"In many cases, their homes know little of",181
d06-072-01,ok,their place of work and their associates at,178
d06-072-02,err,the office or works wonder what they,177
d06-072-03,ok,are possibly like in the surroundings of their,179
d06-072-04,ok,"homes. It is easy, desperately easy, to lead",179
d06-072-05,ok,a 'double' life without ever deliberately,178
d06-072-06,ok,planning to do so or in fact being conscious,180
d06-072-07,ok,of what is going on. It is easier to live life in,178
d06-072-08,ok,"compartments but over the years it builds up,",174
d06-072-09,ok,and to do so inevitably builds up tensions which,176
d06-072-10,err,need to be handled correctly.,175
d06-076-00,ok,Can we then frame some 'rules' which may enable us to live life,156
d06-076-01,ok,"as fully as possible, without having our energy sapped by un-",155
d06-076-02,err,necessary weariness. (a) Order makes for a decrease in tiredness.,154
d06-076-03,ok,We have a saying 'My head will never save my feet'. Time,156
d06-076-04,ok,after time we forget something and have to go back,156
d06-076-05,ok,upstairs or down to the shops.,153
d06-082-00,ok,If we ever stopped to consider how much energy - and time -,186
d06-082-01,ok,we lose this way in the course of a day we would be,183
d06-082-02,err,"staggered. Some of it is inevitable, and we do not want to",184
d06-082-03,ok,"become too pernickety. Nevertheless, we could all probably",185
d06-082-04,ok,be a little more orderly for we so frequently just muddle,184
d06-082-05,ok,through.,181
d06-086-00,ok,The housewife would find life far less tiring,166
d06-086-01,ok,"if she made a list, followed a routine of work",166
d06-086-02,ok,rather than getting from one thing to the next.,163
d06-086-03,ok,The business man would find that he reached,163
d06-086-04,ok,the end of the day with far less strain if,160
d06-086-05,ok,he was a little more systematic. To drift,161
d06-086-06,ok,aimlessly along is more wearying than any-,163
d06-086-07,ok,thing else. If we would only sit down and,162
d06-086-08,ok,write out all the necessary jobs waiting to,161
d06-086-09,ok,"be done and then work quietly through them,",161
d06-086-10,ok,we would find life considerably less exhausting,162
d06-091-00,ok,There may be some who will argue that,179
d06-091-01,ok,"routine destroys the soul. It is so easy,",181
d06-091-02,ok,"they say, to get into a rut. Save us",182
d06-091-03,ok,from the school curriculum and even,179
d06-091-04,ok,worse the school system whereby for,177

d06-091-06,ok,"exactly what, on any given day of the",179
d06-091-07,ok,"week, they are going to have. If - such",180
d06-091-08,ok,a critic may say - you are calling,180
d06-091-09,ok,"us to adventure, do not strangle us before",179
d06-091-10,err,we start by putting us into a strait-jacket,179
d06-096-00,ok,I am more than conscious of this. How anybody,192
d06-096-01,ok,can go through the same routine day in and day,191
d06-096-02,ok,out for forty years I find difficult to understand.,190
d06-096-03,ok,A lot of it is inevitable so that industry and,190
d06-096-04,ok,commerce may be kept going - though if ever,192
d06-096-05,ok,it becomes possible to work out a system,191
d06-096-06,ok,of 'staggered' hours it may do an immense,191
d06-096-07,ok,amount of good over and above relieving,188
d06-096-08,err,the pressure on over-crowded trains.,189
d06-100-00,ok,"As it is, with so much of our life already",178

d06-100-02,ok,hardly like to add further to the dullness,180
d06-100-03,err,which it engenders. But I am not arguing,180
d06-100-04,ok,for this. I know how much of a drag it can be,179
d06-100-05,ok,and I was interested some little while,177
d06-100-06,ok,ago to hear of a school who tried a six-,178
d06-100-07,ok,day timetable.,178
d06-104-00,ok,"They only worked, of course, a five-",175
d06-104-01,ok,day week so that in the first week,173
d06-104-02,ok,Monday to Friday were days one,175
d06-104-03,ok,"to five of the timetable, the following",174
d06-104-04,ok,Monday was day six and Tuesday,174
d06-104-05,ok,started day one again and so on.,173
d06-104-06,ok,By this means they avoided each,173
d06-104-07,ok,week being the same with a pupil,174
d06-104-08,ok,knowing exactly what the subject,171
d06-104-09,ok,would be on Friday afternoon at,172
d06-104-10,ok,3 p.m..,172
d06-107-00,ok,"It was a little complicated to work,",177
d06-107-01,err,"of course, and there had to be a big",178
d06-107-02,ok,notice in the entrance saying which,177
d06-107-03,ok,day of the timetable it was - but,178
d06-107-04,err,it added immensely to the interest,181

e01-102-00,ok,Remember that texture plays an important part in,183
e01-102-01,ok,the beauty of crochet. The finer mercerised threads,181

e01-102-03,ok,"tablecloths, doilies, edgings and accessories, while",180
e01-102-04,ok,"the heavier threads are used for bedspreads,",177
e01-102-05,ok,"chairbacks, luncheon mats, etc. Crochet hooks",177

e01-113-02,ok,lapping long thread over short thread.,168
e01-113-03,ok,3. Hold loop in place between thumb,168
e01-113-04,ok,and forefinger (Fig. 1). 1. Take hold,169
e01-113-05,ok,of broad bar of hook as you would a,163

e01-113-07,ok,rest near tip of hook.,166
e01-119-00,ok,2. Insert hook through loop and under long,162
e01-119-01,ok,thread. Catch long end of thread (Fig. 2).,162
e01-119-02,ok,Draw loop through. 3. Do not remove hook,161
e01-119-03,ok,from thread. Pull short end and ball thread,158

e02-000-03,ok,"extremely easy to work, the four sides being",191
e02-000-04,err,simply planed to give the required taper. In,184
e02-000-05,ok,"the more elaborate varieties, however, a toe is",182
e02-000-06,ok,"worked in the solid, and this certainly",187
e02-000-07,ok,complicates the operation.,189
e02-014-00,ok,For short ones a smoothing plane can be used.,195
e02-014-01,ok,The gauge can now be used to nick in the tapers,195
e02-014-02,ok,"on the newly planed surfaces, and these treated",195
e02-014-03,ok,as before. It is unnecessary to mark the taper with,196
e02-014-04,err,the straight-edge as one relies upon the truth,191
e02-014-05,ok,of the plane sole to make the tapered surfaces,191
e02-014-06,err,straight.,194
e02-018-00,ok,A glance at the gauge marks at the bottom,161
e02-018-01,ok,end reveals when the required amount,160
e02-018-02,ok,"has been removed, and if care is taken",159
e02-018-03,ok,to stop the plane short of the squared,160
e02-018-04,ok,"pencil line at the top, the work will be",157
e02-018-05,ok,accurate. The straight-edge can be used,156
e02-018-06,ok,to test the straightness of the sides.,160
e02-021-00,ok,"Incidentally, it is better to",193
e02-021-01,err,complete any mortising that may be,193
e02-021-02,err,needed at the top before the tapering is,194
e02-021-03,err,begun. Some plain tapered legs have,196
e02-021-04,err,"the taper on the two inner faces only,",191
e02-021-05,ok,the outer surfaces being vertical as,191
e02-021-06,ok,"at (B), Fig. 1. To make a leg such as",194

e02-025-00,ok,Note that squared lines marking,179
e02-025-01,ok,the top member of the toe are,178
e02-025-02,ok,needed as well as the upper ex-,180
e02-025-03,ok,"tent of the taper, and in",180
e02-025-04,ok,this case it is necessary to,172
e02-025-05,ok,mark in the line of the taper,173
e02-025-06,ok,with pencil and straight-edge,178
e02-025-07,err,"as at (B), Fig. 3. A saw cut is",178
e02-025-08,ok,made at the upper toe line,171
e02-025-09,ok,"exactly down to the taper line,",174
e02-025-10,ok,no farther.,179
e02-074-00,err,"But why woodwork in particular? Well, there",190
e02-074-01,ok,are many reasons. Wood is in good and,193
e02-074-02,ok,common supply; it lends itself to making,190
e02-074-03,ok,innumerable useful household items -,191
e02-074-04,ok,"furniture, fitments, garden items, toys, etc.;",184
e02-074-05,ok,it enables results to be obtained fairly,184
e02-074-06,ok,quickly; it is less expensive than most,189
e02-074-07,ok,other materials; it is a pleasant material,189
e02-074-08,err,"to work with; and, although it does",182
e02-074-09,ok,"create a certain amount of mess, it is",184
e02-074-10,ok,all clean and easily cleared away.,191
e02-082-00,ok,This last point is certainly important because almost,173
e02-082-01,err,everyone has come to recognise that machines,170
e02-082-02,ok,"are not only an economic necessity, but that a",171
e02-082-03,ok,great deal of drudgery can be avoided by the,170
e02-082-04,err,installation of a power tool. As an elementary,169

e04-004-00,ok,Start by making the two side frames from 1 in. by 1 1/4 in. planed,157
e04-004-01,ok,timber as shown in Fig. 1. Although the timber will have already,157
e04-004-02,ok,"been machine planed, remember to go over each piece with",157
e04-004-03,ok,"a smoothing plane, otherwise the marks left by the cutters",159
e04-004-04,ok,will show up after painting. The dimensions given enable the,156

e04-008-01,ok,which should nevertheless be cut with care to ensure a neat,155

e04-008-03,err,"each 1 1/4 in. by 1/2 in. by 14 in. which fit into the recesses (C),",159
e04-008-04,ok,cut to fit them.,153
e04-011-00,ok,See Fig. 2. These are then glued and,166
e04-011-01,ok,pinned into place. A similar piece of 1 in.,167
e04-011-02,ok,by 1 1/4 in. by 14 in. timber is fixed across,165

e04-026-00,ok,Finally attach the back firmly to the sides with,175
e04-026-01,ok,screws driven from the inside. The footrest is a,172
e04-026-02,err,piece of timber 14 in. long and about 1/2 in.,171
e04-026-03,ok,by 4 in. attached to the front legs with a pair,171
e04-026-04,ok,of angle irons as shown in Fig. 5. When determining,169

e04-030-03,ok,made by shaping and soldering two pieces of stout,173
e04-030-04,ok,wire as shown in Fig. 6. Make sure that these,170

e04-034-00,err,Punch in all nail and panel pin heads and fill the holes,193
e04-034-01,ok,with plastic wood. Then thoroughly glasspaper the whole,193
e04-034-02,err,framework and round off any sharp edges (such as the,191
e04-034-03,err,"edge of the seat, feeding tray, etc). Fill the grain with a",193
e04-034-04,ok,woodfiller in the usual way and paint the frame in,191
e04-034-05,ok,"a suitable pastel shade, using a contrasting colour",188
e04-034-06,ok,for the seat and the back which can be decorated with,191
e04-034-07,ok,a suitable nursery transfer.,192
e04-038-00,ok,Avoid using lead-based paint as this could prove poisonous,191
e04-038-01,ok,"if junior decides to bite the chair. Finally, it is as well",192
e04-038-02,ok,to cover the footrest with rubber or any such protective,192

e04-043-01,ok,rowing dinghy many of which I have built and,159
e04-043-02,ok,sold. It is especially designed for simplicity in,160
e04-043-03,ok,"construction, cheapness and lightness of weight,",160
e04-043-04,ok,and measures approximately 8 ft. by 4 ft. She,157

e04-043-06,ok,and an outboard motor with a comfortable,157
e04-043-07,ok,margin of freeboard.,159
e04-052-00,ok,"For instance, in Canada we use galvanised nails",163
e04-052-01,ok,in place of screws. We just bend them over and clamp,162
e04-052-02,err,firmly by using a hammer on each side. Over here I've,163
e04-052-03,ok,"always used brass screws, which are more expensive. The first",163
e04-052-04,err,"job is to make your moulds. In Fig. 1 it quotes 3/4 in. five-ply,",160
e04-052-05,err,"but to save money any scrap may be used, and if this",158
e04-052-06,ok,"is nailed and glued together strongly, it may be marked",158
e04-052-07,ok,and cut to shape later.,159
e04-058-00,ok,If you do not have a wooden floor on which to anchor,162
e04-058-01,ok,"the moulds, make a frame of rough lumber as shown in",161
e04-058-02,ok,Fig. 2. The main idea is to have the moulds standing as,162
e04-058-03,ok,"rigid as possible, for it is on these you will be building",162
e04-058-04,ok,"and shaping your little craft, upside-down. For cheapness",161
e04-058-05,ok,I recommend using Douglas Fir Plywood from British,160
e04-058-06,ok,Columbia.,158
e04-062-00,ok,This is hot pressed and resin bonded to ensure,168
e04-062-01,ok,a permanently water proof glue line. Be sure to,168

e04-068-00,ok,I have also included a sketch of paddles I make for,171
e04-068-01,err,"rowing this dinghy (Fig. 3). They are very simple, cheap",168
e04-068-02,ok,and easy to make. As will be seen from the plan,168
e04-068-03,ok,there is only a single gunwale on the outside.,168
e04-068-04,ok,I find that the type of rowlock we use in Canada,167
e04-068-05,err,is difficult to obtain here and expensive. I overcome,166
e04-068-06,err,this in another way as shown in Fig. 4.,164
e04-079-00,ok,Cut the moulds and the,147
e04-079-01,ok,transoms to shape as in the,149
e04-079-02,ok,detailed drawings. If you have,148
e04-079-03,ok,a wooden floor you can use,148
e04-079-04,err,'A' frames fastened to the floor,147
e04-079-05,ok,"if not, use a strong horizontal",145
e04-079-06,err,frame that will sit firmly on,146

e04-083-00,ok,The edges of the transoms should be bevelled to,182
e04-083-01,ok,correspond to the sides and bottom of the boat.,182
e04-083-02,ok,Don't forget to cut out on each side of each mould,181
e04-083-03,ok,to allow for the chines to rest in these,183
e04-083-04,ok,"notches, as they are not fastened to the",179
e04-083-05,ok,"moulds, which will only be used whilst",176
e04-083-06,ok,the hull is under construction.,177
e04-086-00,ok,The chine is the long stringer on each side which,165
e04-086-01,err,is joined to both transoms and lies in the grooves,165
e04-086-02,err,"cut in the moulds. Each chine is made of oak,",167
e04-086-03,ok,"ash, spruce or any long grained flexible wood. I",166
e04-086-04,ok,prefer spruce when available. As will be seen,164
e04-086-05,err,"in the plan, the transoms have a frame 1 in. by 1 in.",162
e04-086-06,ok,on each side.,165
e04-091-00,ok,The chines are morticed into this and butt up,177
e04-091-01,ok,against the transom. Start at the bow and,176
e04-091-02,ok,spring them both at the same time over the,176
e04-091-03,ok,slots cut in the moulds and into the notches,175
e04-091-04,ok,cut for this purpose in the stern or after,175
e04-091-05,err,"transom framing. Glue, screw and make fast.",172
e04-095-00,ok,"The skeleton of the boat will now take shape,",175
e04-095-01,ok,and this is the time to check before making fast,174
e04-095-02,ok,to see that nothing is distorted. Ensure that,174
e04-095-03,ok,the outside measurements from transom to transom,174
e04-095-04,ok,are equal on each side and that the transoms,174
e04-095-05,ok,are parallel horizontally. Next bevel the chines,172
e04-095-06,ok,with a plane so that the bottom will fit snugly.,169
e04-099-00,ok,Cut out the bottom and sides accurately from the,175
e04-099-01,ok,plan measurements but leave sufficient margin for,174
e04-099-02,ok,planing after fixing to the boat. Use your two,174
e04-099-03,ok,lengths of 8 ft. by 4 ft. ply for this,173
e04-099-04,ok,"purpose, the sides from one, and the bottom from",174
e04-099-05,ok,the other. If care is taken not to waste the,170
e04-099-06,ok,"ply, plenty of material is left over for the thwarts.",170
e04-103-00,ok,"Having trimmed up the chines, we are now ready",171
e04-103-01,ok,"to plank the sides. Start again at the bows,",174
e04-103-02,err,clamping into position with a 'D' clamp. Bend,173
e04-103-03,ok,round the frame to the stern and clamp there. If,175
e04-103-04,ok,you have a third clamp use it in the centre as,175
e04-103-05,ok,"well. After generously covering with glue, screw",174
e04-103-06,ok,the sides to the transom framing and the chine.,178
e04-109-00,ok,Use 5/8 by No. 4 gauge screws (brass) or nail,178
e04-109-01,ok,"with inch and a quarter galvanized nails, if",176
e04-109-02,ok,you are doing it that way. Use flat head screws,179
e04-109-03,err,about 4 in. apart and do not counter-sink in,175
e04-109-04,ok,the 1/4 in. ply. Make a very small hole for,180
e04-109-05,ok,the screw to allow for a good grip. Remember,176
e04-109-06,ok,to glue before screwing.,180
e04-114-00,ok,"Clean up with the plane ready for the bottom,",183
e04-114-01,err,which is cut in one piece. It should overlap just a,177
e04-114-02,ok,trifle; this can be cleaned up later. As you are,180
e04-114-03,ok,screwing and gluing this piece to the chines it is,181
e04-114-04,ok,necessary to be careful not to miss the chine with,177
e04-114-05,ok,the screws. I prefer spacing screws 3 in. apart for,178
e04-114-06,ok,"the bottom, both for screwing to the chines and",182
e04-114-07,ok,the bottom shaped transom facing.,178
e04-119-00,err,"Again, don't forget to glue. Now put on the keel and",179
e04-119-01,ok,the rubbing strakes and you are ready to lift the boat off,178
e04-119-02,ok,"the moulds. You won't want them again for this boat, so",179
e04-119-03,ok,shift them right out of the way. Place the boat right side,179
e04-119-04,ok,up on two boxes or trestles of convenient height for,180
e04-119-05,err,working.,176
e04-124-00,err,Fix on the gunwales and insert the thwarts (seats),181
e04-124-01,ok,taking care to reinforce the sides of the dinghy at the seats,182
e04-124-02,ok,with vertical members as shown in the plans. Make the,181
e04-124-03,err,four blocks for the rowlocks and mark their positions,181
e04-124-04,ok,before riveting on the gunwales so that you do not put,183
e04-124-05,err,a rivet where you will have to cut out the inside (gunwale),179
e04-124-06,ok,one to fit the block.,179
e04-127-00,ok,I rivet my gunwales together through the side of the hull,178
e04-127-01,ok,with copper nails and roves. It greatly improves the,177

e04-127-03,ok,undercoat and at least one coat of finishing paint.,179
e04-127-04,ok,WHEN an assortment of differently coloured materials are cut,175
e04-127-05,ok,into a variety of shapes they can be combined by either,173
e04-127-06,err,making fabric pictures or designs.,175
e04-132-00,ok,While these may ultimately be made into a picture,172

e06-000-00,ok,This could hardly happen without the,193
e06-000-01,ok,herring having some orientation with the,191

e06-049-02,ok,that of flat fish on the bottom.,174
e06-049-03,ok,The evidence suggest that the fish are,174
e06-049-04,ok,aware of the moving footrope before,175

e06-049-09,err,to the disturbance.,172
e06-053-00,ok,Then they stop swimming and are caught. In,163
e06-053-01,ok,the seine-net film this usually seemed to,162
e06-053-02,ok,happen just after the fish had risen above,162
e06-053-03,ok,"the footrope, and presumably out of its",162
e06-053-04,ok,"field of disturbance, or bow wave. This suggests",162
e06-053-05,ok,that the wave might be transmitted by the,158
e06-053-06,ok,"sea-bed, though the footrope in this case",160

e06-070-00,ok,Actually the seine net has little or no cover.,180
e06-070-01,ok,And in this film the rise of the fish was,182

f01-066-00,err,And then you get a knock on the head and all evidence of,144

f01-066-03,err,surgical and pharmacological evidence points to a very,139
f01-066-04,err,close connection. There is a lot to be said for keeping the,140
f01-066-05,ok,"word ""soul"" to stand for what many believe to be the imperishable",141
f01-066-06,err,essence of a man which is supposed to persist apart from,142
f01-066-07,ok,"the body, and to reserve the more prosaic word ""mind"" for",140
f01-066-08,ok,the basis of all those experiences and phenomena which,139
f01-066-09,ok,are clearly associated with the brain.,141
f01-070-00,ok,Can we now put forward any reasonably clear,162
f01-070-01,err,"picture of this ""basis"" of mental phenomena?",162
f01-070-02,err,"The physicists have succeeded remarkably well,",161

f01-070-04,ok,picture of the basis of such material phenomena,158
f01-070-05,ok,"as chemical action, magnetism, the behaviour of",159
f01-070-06,ok,gases and so on. Where has psychology got to in its,161
f01-070-07,ok,"theories of ""mind""? Are there any ultimate units",161
f01-070-08,ok,of mind akin to the atoms of matter?,159
f01-075-00,ok,At one time it was thought that mind could indeed,165
f01-075-01,ok,be analysed into discrete bits. These bits were,166
f01-075-02,ok,identified as elementary sensations. These were,165
f01-075-03,ok,thought to combine together to form compound,164
f01-075-04,ok,experiences by analogy with the way atoms of,164
f01-075-05,ok,matter combine to form molecular compounds.,162
f01-075-06,ok,But this view led to too many difficulties and,163
f01-075-07,ok,was finally abandoned. Nevertheless the search,164
f01-075-08,ok,for basic units of mind has gone on and will,163
f01-075-09,ok,"doubtless continue, for it is the aim of science to",163
f01-075-10,ok,discover ultimate units.,162
f01-081-00,err,"We must beware, however, of supposing that there must be any",158
f01-081-01,err,close analogy between the units of quite different,159
f01-081-02,ok,sciences. For example the success of the atomic theory,158
f01-081-03,ok,in physics might lead us to suppose that the ultimate,157
f01-081-04,err,units of geometry must be points. It would be more,159
f01-081-05,err,correct to regard operations as the ultimate units of,159
f01-081-06,err,geometry.,161
f01-085-00,ok,There have been many conflicting tendencies in,157
f01-085-01,ok,psychology in its search for ultimate units and here,156
f01-085-02,ok,we can only indicate what seems to be the most promising,155
f01-085-03,err,concept which is current today. It is known as the schema.,156
f01-085-04,err,It is not an easy concept and if I try to make it,152
f01-085-05,ok,concrete it will be at the cost of over-simplification,152
f01-085-06,err,but even so it may be better than a meaningless abstraction.,157
f01-135-00,ok,It is the tendency to get things,162
f01-135-01,ok,the wrong way round. As a,160
f01-135-02,ok,psychologist I am constantly,160
f01-135-03,ok,encountering this tendency,160
f01-135-04,ok,in friends and acquaintances.,159
f01-135-05,ok,They think there is something,159
f01-135-06,ok,"inevitably ""queer"" about psychology",158
f01-135-07,ok,and this feeling of queerness,159
f01-135-08,ok,usually boils down to a quite,157
f01-135-09,ok,mistaken belief that the,158
f01-135-10,ok,psychologist first looks into ...,159
f01-139-00,ok,"This is what I mean by ""getting things the wrong way",161
f01-139-01,err,"round"". He is far more likely to find out about how",161
f01-139-02,ok,his own mind works by looking at other people's.,161
f01-139-03,ok,"For although looking inwards (or ""introspecting""",161
f01-139-04,ok,"as it is called), is not entirely ruled out,",159
f01-139-05,ok,nowadays most psychologists would agree that it is,158
f01-139-06,ok,one of the most unreliable methods of getting,160
f01-139-07,ok,any precise information.,160
f01-143-00,err,And so they prefer objective methods. Since they cannot,173
f01-143-01,ok,directly look into the mental processes of another,173
f01-143-02,ok,person they observe his visible behaviour and then try,173
f01-143-03,ok,to give theoretical interpretations of what lies behind,175
f01-143-04,ok,this behaviour. This is no more queer than the method,174
f01-143-05,ok,"of the doctor who observes signs, and records symptoms,",172
f01-143-06,ok,and diagnoses the inner states responsible for them.,174
f01-147-00,ok,He may never have had the disease himself but he,167
f01-147-01,ok,can nevertheless identify it. Similarly the psychologist has,165
f01-147-02,ok,to be prepared to observe and make inferences about,167
f01-147-03,ok,"all kinds of processes in other people, whether or not they",165
f01-147-04,ok,correspond with anything in his own experience. We know,163

f04-035-00,ok,Day by day the police followed up likely and even unlikely,188

f04-035-02,ok,"money to her relatives, and her brother-in-law was asked for",187
f04-035-03,err,a detailed account of his movements on the 11th. The dead,187
f04-035-04,ok,woman had been engaged once before - to a barman,185

f04-039-04,ok,for a man who had been seen leaving the train,179

f04-049-03,ok,"dford for a false moustache, it left him with something to",155
f04-049-04,err,explain. His story was that he had left home to try to,154
f04-049-05,ok,join the Army (presumably feeling that a moustache might enhance,153
f04-049-06,ok,"his military bearing), and this was accepted.",156
f04-053-00,ok,"And so the inquest, which had dragged on, with",171

f04-057-04,ok,sinister in the idea of tunnels. The building of,164

f04-079-00,ok,"Both her wrists bore the marks of severe bruising,",168

g04-017-05,ok,"Passion Plays, an interval of ten years, another play would be",169
g04-017-06,ok,"performed at the small theatre in the village, when new talent would",169
g04-017-07,ok,be discovered and trained.,170
g04-022-00,ok,"After the First World War, 1914, I did not visit",150
g04-022-01,ok,"Germany for ten years, by which time in",150
g04-022-02,ok,1924 I was in a different parish in Surrey.,149
g04-022-03,ok,Towards the end of my five and a half years',149
g04-022-04,ok,incumbency I was asked if I would start,149
g04-022-05,ok,a village choral society and conduct it.,148
g04-022-06,ok,"This opened up a new interest, and we plunged",145
g04-022-07,ok,into it.,146
g04-026-00,ok,First of all simple part-songs: I found only one member who had,173
g04-026-01,ok,any idea of reading music. This was the village doctor who was an,174
g04-026-02,ok,old school friend at Clifton. He could sustain the tenor part quite well,172
g04-026-03,ok,and lead the others. As for basses and altos the conductor had to,170
g04-026-04,ok,"teach by singing the parts with them. It was very amusing, and by",168
g04-026-05,ok,the end of a few months an enthusiastic choir of men and women,168
g04-026-06,ok,could render simple part-singing tolerably well.,170
g04-032-00,ok,Then we went to work on Coleridge Taylor's 'Hiawatha's,174
g04-032-01,ok,"Wedding Feast.' Enthusiasm grew, and in a few more months we",168
g04-032-02,ok,"gave a concert at which the accompanist was the village schoolmaster,",171
g04-032-03,ok,and the tenor solo 'Onaway awake' was sung by the Rector.,171
g04-032-04,err,"Friends from Limpsfield, in addition to the villagers, came up,",172
g04-032-05,ok,and we were all happy.,168
g04-036-00,ok,"IN 1913 Dr. Burge, Bishop of Southwark, asked me to go as",151
g04-036-01,err,"Vicar of St. Mark's, Woodcote, Purley, a new church built",152
g04-036-02,err,"by the well-known architect Mr. George Fellowes Prynne,",151
g04-036-03,ok,"who was to become a very intimate friend, and I was",152
g04-036-04,err,later on joint executor of his estate with his,150
g04-036-05,ok,solicitor cousin. As Bishop Talbot had told me that I,149
g04-036-06,ok,"ought not to spend many years in Tatsfield, we held",150
g04-036-07,ok,great family consultations.,152
g04-039-00,ok,My eldest brother was then living in Limpsfield with,152
g04-039-01,ok,"his family, and found a very suitable house nearby",152
g04-039-02,ok,"where my mother settled, and eventually died in 1926",151
g04-039-03,err,at the age of 92. Dr. Burge was not able to be present,151
g04-039-04,ok,at the Institution and Induction Service in St. Mark's.,149
g04-039-05,ok,"This was taken by the Suffragan Bishop of Woolwich,",150
g04-039-06,err,"Dr. John Leake, who lived at Blackheath, and was",150
g04-039-07,ok,a close friend of ours.,151
g04-043-00,ok,But what a change from the dear little old church,180
g04-043-01,ok,at Tatsfield to the great modern church of St. Mark's,184
g04-043-02,ok,"at Purley. One felt at Tatsfield that, small as the",182
g04-043-03,err,"church was, it had its own atmosphere, and for centuries",182
g04-043-04,ok,had been a House of Prayer. I could not but feel the,182
g04-043-05,ok,"chilliness of the new church, beautiful as it was and is.",184
g04-043-06,ok,When we had found a group of people who gladly,185
g04-043-07,ok,"co-operated, we made the little side chapel a place",182
g04-043-08,ok,of daily prayer.,178
g04-048-00,ok,I suggested to the congregation that it needed,178
g04-048-01,ok,"warming up by constant prayer and worship, and we",178
g04-048-02,ok,found many to help. Gifts of candlesticks and,182
g04-048-03,ok,stained-glass lancet windows - finally a new altar -,179
g04-048-04,ok,helped to furnish the chapel as a little sanctuary,178
g04-048-05,ok,for prayer and quiet. In time we received similar,177
g04-048-06,err,"gifts for the High Altar, and large East and West",182
g04-048-07,ok,windows.,176
g04-052-00,ok,It was very interesting to have the privilege of filling,183
g04-052-01,ok,such a beautiful building with suitable fittings; I made,182
g04-052-02,err,a rule that all gifts should be submitted for approval to,182
g04-052-03,ok,"the architect, himself a fine artist. It is quite possible",183
g04-052-04,ok,to put beautiful things into a beautiful church,182
g04-052-05,ok,and yet spoil the building with ornaments unsui-,183
g04-052-06,ok,table to the environs.,182
g04-055-00,ok,We also had a little Mission Hall leading off,184
g04-055-01,ok,"the Brighton Road, in a street full of small houses.",183
g04-055-02,ok,This was called Ellen Avenue when I first went,180
g04-055-03,ok,"there, but was soon changed into the better-",184
g04-055-04,err,sounding name of Lansdowne Road. There,182
g04-055-05,ok,"were lots of children there, and we had",183
g04-055-06,ok,a flourishing Sunday School and an evening,183
g04-055-07,err,service. I soon saw that the parish needed,183
g04-055-08,ok,more help both at the church and Mission,182
g04-055-09,ok,district.,179
g04-060-00,ok,The Church Army Captain had done very good work in the,178
g04-060-01,ok,"Lansdowne Road district, but I needed more help in the",179
g04-060-02,ok,church for the full rota of services on Sundays and weekdays.,180
g04-060-03,err,Most fortunately I was able to engage the Rev. E. U. Evitt in,181
g04-060-04,ok,"1913 soon after I had come, and he organized the Mission",182
g04-060-05,ok,"district and got to know, and be known by, many of",178
g04-060-06,ok,the people of the parish.,180
g04-063-00,ok,A great blow disturbed all our efforts in the following,178
g04-063-01,err,"year, 1914, when war broke out. Very soon Chaplains for",179
g04-063-02,ok,"the Forces were urgently needed, and I felt clearly",178
g04-063-03,ok,"that one of us must volunteer. The Bishop, Dr. Burge, did",181
g04-063-04,ok,"not wish me to go then, as I had barely been in the parish",178
g04-063-05,err,"for a year. Mr. Evitt, however, was much less committed",178
g04-063-06,err,"than his Vicar, and he was accepted at once and",176
g04-063-07,ok,was very soon in France where he did splendid,178
g04-063-08,ok,work until his health broke down and he had a bad,176
g04-063-09,ok,attack of enteric fever.,175
g04-068-00,ok,Meanwhile in Purley there was much activity and much,184
g04-068-01,err,co-operation especially with the other Christian communities.,186
g04-068-02,ok,At a large public meeting we launched the project known as the,187
g04-068-03,err,'Coulsdon and Purley Patriotic Fund' in whose counsels and committees,187
g04-068-04,err,"I found myself deeply involved. At first, the main work was to help",184
g04-068-05,ok,wives and relations of the soldiers to get their 'Separation',183
g04-068-06,err,"allowances, but soon, alas!, as casualties began and increased",185
g04-068-07,ok,in the winter of 1914 and 1915 the matter of War Pensions,185
g04-068-08,err,"became very urgent, and I was asked to be Chairman",184
g04-068-09,ok,of the Committee in Coulsdon and Purley.,183
g04-072-00,err,"Indeed, for the next seventeen years, during my time at",184
g04-072-01,ok,"Purley, and from 1922 at Surbiton, I was continuously",184
g04-072-02,err,Chairman of the local War Pensions Committee. This,181
g04-072-03,ok,task involved a very great deal of detailed work for,182
g04-072-04,ok,"the Committee. We had a splendid body of local residents,",184
g04-072-05,err,and a series of excellent Honorary Secretaries. Our,183
g04-072-06,ok,"Committee met once a week in the evenings, and",184
g04-072-07,ok,included professional men from every walk of,182
g04-072-08,ok,life.,181
g04-077-00,ok,Very soon we managed to get a hut in Purley where soldiers,180
g04-077-01,ok,were very welcome and the ladies organized a canteen. Life was,183
g04-077-02,ok,in those years more than busy. We now had a vicarage next,180
g04-077-03,ok,"to the church, and I was most fortunate in having for eight",183
g04-077-04,ok,years a most able and devoted housekeeper whom I had known,180
g04-077-05,ok,well in Limpsfield where she had a house next to the,178
g04-077-06,err,church.,174
g04-081-00,ok,On hearing that I was to leave Tatsfield and come to,185
g04-081-01,ok,Purley she offered to come and look after me. She was,186
g04-081-02,ok,"a real treasure, of yeoman stock and clever in all domestic",181
g04-081-03,ok,"things, a widow who knew how to look after the 'boy,'",182
g04-081-04,ok,who was the only other occupant of the house when,184
g04-081-05,err,Mr. Evitt had gone.,181
g04-088-00,ok,We gathered together a splendid Sunday,180
g04-088-01,err,"afternoon service at the church, each child",182
g04-088-02,ok,"being given a number which, as they came into",179
g04-088-03,err,"church, they could just whisper to",178
g04-088-04,ok,the superintendent who filled in the regi-,176
g04-088-05,ok,ster at her own home. Each child had a,172
g04-088-06,ok,picture given them and the lesson was,175
g04-088-07,ok,largely based on this. It was on a,178
g04-088-08,ok,stamp which could be stuck in,175
g04-088-09,ok,"their book, and there was quite a",178
g04-088-10,ok,clamour for back stamps if a child,176
g04-088-11,err,had to miss the Sunday Church from any cause,174
g04-092-00,ok,It was quite amusing to see how much,179
g04-092-01,err,"the children enjoyed the service, and I heard",180
g04-092-02,ok,of parents or faithful nurses threaten any,181
g04-092-03,err,naughty child with the penalty of not being,177
g04-092-04,err,allowed to come to the Children's Church,172
g04-092-05,err,on Sunday afternoon. I hope the threat,178
g04-092-06,err,"kept them good in the week, but anyway",178
g04-092-07,err,"they were a most delightful lot, and",179
g04-092-08,ok,it is a great joy to meet them now,179
g04-092-09,ok,fifty years afterwards when so many,177
g04-092-10,err,are parents or even grandparents,179
g04-095-00,ok,Speaking of churchwardens and children leads,167
g04-095-01,ok,me at once to chronicle a most intimate and,166
g04-095-02,ok,lasting friendship begun in 1913 in Purley and,167
g04-095-03,ok,continuing till old age to-day. When I went,167
g04-095-04,ok,"to St. Mark's, the first contact I made was",164
g04-095-05,err,"with the Vicar's Warden, Mr. F. W. Charlton",166
g04-095-06,err,"and his family, the youngest of whose three",164
g04-095-07,ok,sons was just coming into the world in this year,163
g04-095-08,ok,of 1913.,164
g04-098-00,ok,From then till now the acquaintance ripened into a very,171
g04-098-01,ok,deep friendship which I have taken with me through,165
g04-098-02,err,all the many vicissitudes of a long ministry. Mr. and,162
g04-098-03,ok,Mrs. Charlton have been from the first difficult,162
g04-098-04,ok,"years of war, when most lives were upset and",160
g04-098-05,ok,"some tempers were easily frayed, the most",159
g04-098-06,err,loyal and devoted friends.,161
g04-101-00,ok,Their homes - for since those years they have,164
g04-101-01,ok,lived on in Purley - have always been,165
g04-101-02,ok,"havens of rest, and the welcome has never",163
g04-101-03,ok,"failed. Their three boys, now successful men,",163
g04-101-04,err,were in our Children's Church from the,163
g04-101-05,ok,"outset, and when we don't see one",160
g04-101-06,ok,another we do not forget.,160
g04-104-00,ok,"In those early years 1914-18, life was very full",151
g04-104-01,ok,both in the parish and in the wider war activities.,149
g04-104-02,ok,"The Bishop, knowing that I spent my holidays in",149
g04-104-03,ok,"Bavaria, asked me if I would do something for two wards",149
g04-104-04,ok,"at the Royal Herbert Hospital, full of war prisoners.",147
g04-104-05,ok,"I was very glad to help in this way, and visited them",148
g04-104-06,ok,"frequently, establishing at once a friendly contact with",148
g04-104-07,ok,the Bavarian wounded who were delighted to find,147
g04-104-08,ok,someone who knew their native villages.,148
g04-108-00,ok,I could at once notice the great antagonism,150
g04-108-01,ok,between the Bavarians and the Prussians who openly,150
g04-108-02,ok,scorned these more simple country folk.,149
g05-087-00,ok,Less than no response from the Russian side led,162
g05-087-01,ok,one to fear that the event might well have the,162
g05-087-02,ok,outcome that the Nazis evidently hoped might,162
g05-087-03,err,lead to disaster. Then there had been much talk of,162
g05-087-04,ok,the setting up among the German population of a,162
g05-087-05,ok,"general system of ""francs-tireurs"", to be named",162
g05-087-06,ok,"""Werewolves"".",162
g05-094-00,ok,The Nazi fortress concept turned out to be nothing,182
g05-094-01,ok,more than a fantasy. Thanks to the good,186
g05-094-02,ok,"sense of the front line soldiers, the",182
g05-094-03,ok,meeting of East and West was marked by,182
g05-094-04,ok,the use of no weapon more lethal than,182
g05-094-05,ok,vodka. And the effect on the German people,182
g05-094-06,ok,of the first ten years of the promised,186
g05-094-07,ok,"thousand of Nazi rule, so far from creating",186
g05-094-08,ok,"a spirit of warlike frenzy, had produced",182
g05-094-09,ok,universally a dull bewildered apathy.,182
g05-098-00,ok,So far had our thinking led us in this matter of the,181
g05-098-01,ok,"""Werewolves"" that we had contemplated the necessity of very",181
g05-098-02,ok,special precautions to guard the lives of our airmen. Particular,181
g05-098-03,ok,"hatred, we felt, was bound to be aimed at the representatives of",182
g05-098-04,ok,"those who had, over the years, spread such ghastly havoc, destruction",179
g05-098-05,ok,"and death over Germany, causing such wholesale slaughter among",179

h06-082-03,ok,It is therefore safer both in principle and,192
h06-082-04,ok,practice to keep the worker away from,192

j06-056-00,ok,Loeb first suggested the importance,187
j06-056-01,ok,of light as the governing factor,188
j06-056-02,ok,but combined its influence with that,186
j06-056-03,ok,"of gravity. Later authors, in particular",185
j06-056-04,ok,"Rose, have proposed that light",185
j06-056-05,ok,alone can provide an adequate,183
j06-056-06,ok,"mechanism if the animals have,",184
j06-056-07,ok,"and select by exploration, a",185
j06-056-08,err,zone of optimum light intensity.,183
j06-056-09,err,This view has been enlarged,184
j06-056-10,ok,with a suggestion that both,184
j07-000-00,ok,This resulted in units of much lighter weight than could be,136
j07-000-01,ok,obtained with tubular constructions. The growth of the,136
j07-000-02,ok,aircraft industry brought even greater emphasis to the need,135
j07-000-03,ok,"for lightweight compact heat exchangers. During the 1930's,",136
j07-000-04,ok,the secondary surface plate-and-corrugation construction,130
j07-000-05,ok,"became established for aero-engine radiators, using",128
j07-000-06,ok,dip-soldered copper. The air and engine-coolant passages,133
j07-000-07,ok,were separated by flat plates.,132
j07-005-00,ok,The air passages were packed with corrugated,136
j07-005-01,err,foil bonded to the primary plates to,136
j07-005-02,ok,provide the necessary surface area for heat transfer.,137
j07-005-03,ok,"The narrower coolant passages were also packed with foil,",137
j07-005-04,err,chiefly to provide sufficient support for the flat plates to withstand,135
j07-005-05,err,the coolant pressure loadings. The introduction of the aluminium alloy,132
j07-005-06,err,dip-brazing process in the early 1940's was quickly taken up,135
j07-005-07,err,for aircraft heat exchangers and led to substantial,138
j07-005-08,err,weight reductions as compared with copper construction.,136
j07-009-00,ok,This development coincided with the introduction of,135
j07-009-01,ok,pressurized aircraft cabins and the demand for air-to-air,134
j07-009-02,ok,cabin coolers. Although in this case the heat transfer,135
j07-009-03,ok,coefficients on the two sides of the heat exchanger,136
j07-009-04,ok,"were of comparable magnitude, the use of",133
j07-009-05,ok,"secondary surface was still attractive, since the",129
j07-009-06,ok,greater part of the surface area could be made up,132
j07-009-07,ok,of fins only 0.006 in. (0.15 mm.) thick.,134
j07-012-00,err,"Furthermore, developments in the detail form of",134
j07-012-01,ok,the fins made possible a reduction in the total,136
j07-012-02,ok,surface area required as compared with the use of,136
j07-012-03,ok,smooth continuous passages for the same thermal,136
j07-012-04,ok,duty and pressure losses. The properties of,133
j07-012-05,ok,"compact form, low weight, and design flexibility",131
j07-012-06,ok,thus developed found ready application on a,134
j07-012-07,ok,much larger scale with the introduction of tonnage,134

j07-015-01,ok,extremely flexible. Figure 3 illustrates the,135
j07-015-02,ok,arrangement of a single passage. This can be,135
j07-015-03,err,extended in length and width up to the limit of,135
j07-015-04,ok,manufacturing equipment available. The corrugation,131

k04-005-03,ok,"he could collect his wits to reply to this, there was a bustle",189

k04-010-00,ok,The party was now preparing to see,148

k04-010-04,ok,"wished to follow the sightseers, there seemed",145
k04-010-05,ok,no alternative. As she was about to mount,145
k04-010-06,ok,a wide and shallow flight of marble,146

k04-014-02,err,"interested in her cousin's wife, whom she was regarding",166
k04-014-03,ok,through half-closed eyes. This was a slight shock to,165

k04-017-03,ok,"the answer. Disturbed by vague uneasiness, she",177
k04-017-04,ok,was wondering whether Olimpia had been,176
k04-017-05,ok,watching her talk with Orsini. Surely she,174
k04-017-06,ok,could not have overheard anything they,173
k04-017-07,err,said? A moment's reflection reassured her,175
k04-017-08,ok,"on that point, for she was certain no one",173
k04-017-09,ok,had been standing near them.,174
k04-022-00,err,"However, something inimical in the girl's look",166
k04-022-01,ok,put Vittoria on guard. 'Santa Maria! These spying,166

k04-039-01,ok,'Olimpia is watching us. The young man with her is,182

k04-057-00,ok,"Vittoria, accompanied by her maid, Lucia, was on her",189

k04-057-03,err,money from that indulgent parent to settle her mounting,186
k04-057-04,ok,debts. Lucia was thinking how beautiful her mistress,183
k04-057-05,err,"looked, and how cunningly the olive-green dress",184
k04-057-06,ok,with its underskirt of rose-brocade fitted her,187

k04-061-03,ok,of her grey life with the splendid one that filled,189
k04-061-04,err,"her dreams. At the Villa Montalto she felt an alien,",186
k04-061-05,err,and although she had repeatedly urged Francesco,184
k04-061-06,ok,"to give her a separate establishment, he invariably",185
k04-061-07,ok,"pleaded his financial dependence on his uncle, who",184
k04-061-08,err,had built the villa for his family.,183
k04-064-00,ok,He reminded her that they must abide by Roman,176
k04-064-01,ok,"custom, and dwell there with their relations. Her",178
k04-064-02,ok,values were those of the materialist who assesses,175
k04-064-03,ok,"every human being in terms of fame, power and",174
k04-064-04,ok,"wealth. Francesco she despised for his dullness, his",174

k04-068-00,ok,"Her husband's gentleness and amiability, his unselfish",177
k04-068-01,ok,"love for her, she regarded as signs of weakness. He was a",176
k04-068-02,ok,futile creature who had not even proved capable of giving,176
k04-068-03,ok,her a child. Whatever passion she had experienced in the,174
k04-068-04,ok,first months of marriage had been ousted by contempt.,172
k04-068-05,ok,She had never loved him. Her thoughts rushed to Orsini.,175
k04-068-06,ok,"Since the meeting in the Doria Palace, no word had",175

k04-075-00,ok,"She had, perhaps, demanded too much. The",184

k04-075-03,err,"if she yielded to him, her passion could,",182
k04-075-04,ok,"indeed, match his. Every instinct urged her to",180
k04-075-05,err,"surrender, for there was that in his nature",181
k04-075-06,ok,to which her own had responded as it,184
k04-075-07,ok,had responded to no other human being.,182
k04-079-00,ok,"Prudence, ambition and reason had",181

k04-079-03,ok,compromise. For a brief interval,182
k04-079-04,ok,she allowed herself the luxury of,180
k04-079-05,ok,dreams. She began to imagine life at,179
k04-079-06,err,"Bracciano, the balls and fe*?5tes, the",179

k04-079-10,ok,"Orsini, placing a chaplet of roses on the brows",181
k04-085-00,ok,This reverie was rudely ended as the coach gave a,191
k04-085-01,err,"sickening jolt and came to an abrupt stop, nearly throwing",192
k04-085-02,ok,the two girls from their seats. Lucia uttered a cry of,192
k04-085-03,ok,"alarm. 'Look, madonna, we are surrounded!' It was true.",192
k04-085-04,ok,Men armed with pikes and daggers swarmed about,191
k04-085-05,err,"them and a lean, swarthy fellow was peering through",192
k04-085-06,err,"the window, grinning impudently. 'Santa Maria!'",192
k04-085-07,ok,shrieked Lucia. 'Banditti!',187
k04-093-00,ok,Vittoria now realized that they were outside,192

k04-093-02,ok,crouching in the doorway of the church and exhibiting,193

k04-093-04,ok,"Lucia,' said Vittoria, pointing to the badge on the man's",191
k04-093-05,err,shoulder. The words were clear. 'Beware my hug!' Lucia,190
k04-093-06,ok,stared speechlessly at the golden bear; Vittoria swiftly,190
k04-093-07,ok,averted her head to avoid the impertinent glance,189
k04-093-08,err,of the retainer.,189
k04-099-00,ok,Her thoughts at this moment were chaotic. The,179
k04-099-01,ok,"coach now turned in another direction, towards",179
k04-099-02,ok,the wild and desolate region behind the baths.,179
k04-099-03,ok,"It was sparsely inhabited, dotted with fallow fields",179
k04-099-04,ok,"and terraced vineyards, and here and there jutted",179
k04-099-05,ok,"a brown outcrop of flower-wreathed ruins, a pathetic",177

k04-103-00,ok,In this region of Monti most of the public baths,181
k04-103-01,ok,"had been built in the time of the Caesars, but with the",180
k04-103-02,ok,breaking of the aqueducts during the barbarian invasions,179
k04-103-03,ok,the baths had lost their purpose; they had become,180
k04-103-04,err,stone quarries and their precious marble had been,176
k04-103-05,err,burnt for lime. Now escaped criminals and bandits,178
k04-103-06,ok,"used these quarries as hiding places, to the danger",176

k04-106-00,ok,"As they lumbered past at a rattling pace, Vittoria",189
k04-106-01,ok,could see a wisp of smoke curling above the fire of a,192
k04-106-02,ok,gypsy encampment and a few tatterdemalion creatures,192
k04-106-03,ok,"gathered about it, cooking their frugal meal. These",192
k04-106-04,ok,were left far behind. An old man belabouring an,187

k04-110-03,ok,"initial shock, Vittoria felt calm. She",179
k04-110-04,ok,"knew exactly what she wanted, and",177
k04-110-05,ok,"was prepared to take it without scruple,",179
k04-110-06,ok,if she could. What she had forgotten,179
k04-110-07,ok,in her self-absorption in her own schemes,180
k04-110-08,ok,was that other people were equally absorbed,180
k04-110-09,ok,"in their schemes, which were likely to",178
k04-110-10,err,run counter to her own.,179
k04-115-00,ok,This move today was a reminder of that fact.,186
k04-115-01,ok,Whilst she automatically patted the hand of,184
k04-115-02,ok,"the agitated Lucia, her brain was working",181
k04-115-03,ok,"rapidly, and she decided that she must be",178
k04-115-04,err,"prepared to counter Orsini's demands,",182
k04-115-05,ok,difficult though that would be. She became,179

k04-115-07,err,now the coach stopped.,177
k04-119-00,ok,The moment had come. Upon the ensuing interview,191
k04-119-01,err,"the future would depend. Outwardly she was calm, but",190
k04-119-02,ok,"her heart was beating fast, and the palms of her",190
k04-119-03,ok,hands were damp. Orsini's high-crowned hat with,190
k04-119-04,ok,its jaunty plume blotted out the light; his hand,187
k04-119-05,err,was on the door. Glancing at Lucia he said in,185
k04-119-06,err,French to Vittoria: 'Your maid ... is she reliable?',187
k04-126-00,err,"She shrugged her shoulders, and replied in the same",174

k04-126-02,ok,"'I see. I know how to deal with people like that,'",174
k04-126-03,ok,"and turning to the cowering Lucia, he spoke in her",176
k04-126-04,err,"own language. 'Do you know who I am?' 'No,",174
k04-126-05,err,"signor,' she whispered. 'I am the Orsini. My word is",174

k04-136-00,ok,Lucia was regarding him as a rabbit looks at a stoat.,175
k04-136-01,ok,"Thrusting his head farther into the coach, he said",176
k04-136-02,ok,sombrely: 'Have you ever heard of a punishment called,175
k04-136-03,err,the cord?' She blanched and shrank away. Was there not,174
k04-136-04,err,a street near Sant' Angelo called the Lane of the Corda,175
k04-136-05,err,"where criminals were hoisted by their wrists forty, fifty,",173
k04-136-06,err,"sixty feet into the air, and dropped again and again, until",174
k04-136-07,err,their arms were wrenched from their sockets. 'You have,174
k04-136-08,ok,heard of it?,171
k04-142-00,ok,The Orsini give that to traitors. There is,175
k04-142-01,ok,no escaping the vengeance of an Orsini. We hunt,170
k04-142-02,ok,"a traitor down to the ends of the earth, and no",168
k04-142-03,ok,power can save him ... or her. Do you understand?',168
k04-142-04,err,"'Yes, signor,' she faltered. 'On the other hand,' he",168
k04-142-05,ok,"continued, giving her a keen look, 'the Orsini are",167
k04-142-06,ok,generous to those who serve them faithfully.,164

k04-149-02,ok,with flushed cheeks and eyes sparkling with,164
k04-149-03,err,"anger. 'And now, madonna,' he said smoothly, 'we will",164
k04-149-04,err,continue the conversation started at the Doria,163
k04-149-05,err,"Palace. Be pleased to alight.' 'I think,' she replied",162
k04-149-06,err,"coolly, 'I prefer to stay where I am.'",163
k04-156-00,err,"'In that case,' he reverted to French, 'I shall be obliged",177
k04-156-01,err,"to lift you from the coach.' Without answering him, she",179
k04-156-02,err,"rose, and bending over the agitated girl, said softly:",179
k04-156-03,err,"'No one will harm you, Lucia. Remain here.' Ignoring his",179
k04-156-04,err,"proffered hand, she stepped from the vehicle. 'Will you",180
k04-156-05,ok,be so good as to order your men not to molest my,180
k04-156-06,err,"maid,' she said coldly to Orsini.",184
k04-163-00,err,"'She is absolutely safe,' he replied; but he turned,",179
k04-163-01,ok,"nevertheless, to the man who had peered into the",179
k04-163-02,ok,"coach, whom he had addressed as Luigi, and gave him sharp",179
k04-163-03,ok,"instructions on the matter. Vittoria stood looking about her,",178
k04-163-04,ok,breathing the scent of thyme. The land at her feet sloped,177
k04-163-05,ok,"away into a tiny valley beyond which, on the crest",180
k04-163-06,ok,"of a wooded hill-side, the ruins of a small temple",184
k04-163-07,ok,were etched against the clear blue of the sky.,177
k07-059a-00,ok,"He forgot time and place. He, the master, was gently",179
k07-059a-01,ok,"led along erotic paths which he knew existed, but",179
k07-059a-02,ok,had never trodden. He learned how to use his,180
k07-059a-03,ok,"hands, how to adore that body without haste, how",181
k07-059a-04,ok,"to caress every inch with his mouth as well, to",179
k07-059a-05,ok,creep down along her smooth muscles till he lost,175
k07-059a-06,ok,himself in a rapture of kisses in places he'd,177
k07-059a-07,ok,"dreamed of, where life began to ooze and quickened",177
k07-059a-08,ok,his heart beat to a thunder.,175
k07-063a-00,ok,"He looked at her. Head thrown back in a pool of hair,",179
k07-063a-01,ok,her blood-red lips parted and the beating of her,181
k07-063a-02,ok,heart in the full throat. Her mouth did things he,178
k07-063a-03,ok,thought no human being could stand without,181
k07-063a-04,ok,"dying, but he went on living in an ocean of",178
k07-063a-05,ok,"voluptuousness, that swelled and ebbed over him,",174
k07-063a-06,ok,"under him, in him and through him...",176
k07-067a-00,ok,He was having a ball! He twiddled the TV set with,180
k07-067a-01,ok,shaking hands. She sat calmly on the bed smoking,177
k07-067a-02,ok,a cigarette. His face was white with two red,177
k07-067a-03,err,blotches. Hers was flushed and lovely. O.K. teacher!,178
k07-067a-04,ok,Was that any better? You know it was! You don't,178
k07-067a-05,ok,"need teaching, only a little coaxing.",174
k07-077-00,ok,He sat down and ran his finger down along her,180
k07-077-01,ok,spine. Do you love me now? Like yesterday! I'm,180
k07-077-02,err,extremely fond of you. The fact that you're beginning,176
k07-077-03,ok,to satisfy my physical wants does not change that.,180
k07-077-04,ok,Before long you'll give me the satisfaction that'll set,180
k07-077-05,ok,"me rocking on my feet, but I'll still be only fond of",176
k07-077-06,ok,you. But you wouldn't marry me?,176
k07-085-00,ok,No. I'm not your type. I'd make you miserable. I,180
k07-085-01,ok,mean that. I'd very probably be unfaithful and,180
k07-085-02,ok,"that'd kill you. Then I'd be unfaithful too, to teach",180
k07-085-03,err,you a lesson. It wouldn't work. You'd do it to,180
k07-085-04,ok,spite me. I would never do it for that reason.,180
k07-085-05,ok,To me it'd be immaterial whether you'd retaliate,176
k07-085-06,ok,or not. You'd go crazy if that situation arose.,180
k07-122-00,ok,To observe the colour rise in her cheek,183
k07-122-01,ok,"and hear her breath come faster, to see",187
k07-122-02,ok,the slight beads of sweat come out on,182
k07-122-03,ok,her glistening skin and see her move,180
k07-122-04,ok,with uncontrolled rhythm. To have her twist,180
k07-122-05,ok,in an attempt to receive a caress he was,180
k07-122-06,ok,"purposely withholding, to hear her deep-throated",176
k07-122-07,ok,moan of full satisfaction and feel her,176
k07-122-08,ok,"shivering, clawing surrender.",176
k07-125-00,ok,"Not so dusty, she might say afterwards, drawing at",182
k07-125-01,ok,a cigarette. It's a wow! he said. She kissed,187
k07-125-02,ok,him motherly: You just wait till you teach the,180
k07-125-03,ok,girl you really love. He didn't protest any more,180
k07-125-04,ok,to say he loved her because he knew it to,176
k07-125-05,ok,be untrue. Instead he said: Will that be,176
k07-125-06,ok,better? She nodded:,176
k07-134-00,ok,It's man's nature to teach and to teach those,181
k07-134-01,ok,we love is double pleasure. And she,177
k07-134-02,err,might add: And don't forget to leave the,181
k07-134-03,ok,lights on. You lose half the fun when you,181
k07-134-04,ok,fumble in the dark. She had many direct,181
k07-134-05,ok,comments like that. Once she quietly,177
k07-134-06,ok,pushed him back when he kissed her too,177
k07-134-07,ok,fully and too soon:,181
k07-141-00,ok,"Oi, not yet, you oaf. What do you think my",180
k07-141-01,ok,mouth is? A billposter's bucket to be,187
k07-141-02,ok,plunged in at random? He'd learned to,180
k07-141-03,ok,laugh when something went wrong or the,180
k07-141-04,ok,"situation became ludicrous, as when they",180
k07-141-05,ok,were both caught in the raw when he'd,180
k07-141-06,ok,forgotten to lock his door and Derek,173
k07-141-07,ok,had walked in unexpectedly.,180
k07-146-00,ok,They'd just had time to nip into the,180
k07-146-01,ok,bathroom and stood there shivering for,180
k07-146-02,ok,fifteen minutes while their guest was,180
k07-146-03,ok,smoking a cigarette waiting for him.,176
k07-146-04,ok,At last Derek got tired and left.,176
k07-146-05,ok,"Just in time, erupted Charlie. If he'd",176
k07-146-06,ok,stayed any longer I'd jolly well,173
k07-146-07,ok,have asked him to join us. I'm so,180
k07-146-08,ok,darned cold I could do with two men.,176
k07-152-00,ok,"You perverted sex-maniac, you wouldn't",182
k07-152-01,ok,dare. Show me what you can do and,182
k07-152-02,ok,I'll tell you if you need help.,179
k07-152-03,ok,Once he came back to the subject,182
k07-152-04,ok,of her marriage and asked her why,179
k07-152-05,ok,she was going to marry her sculptor.,179
k07-152-06,ok,"Because I love him, of course.",179
k07-152-07,ok,What do you think?,179
k07-158-00,err,"But he's a lot older, isn't he?",186
k07-158-01,ok,I suppose so. What attracts you?,182
k07-158-02,ok,It can't be physical? Of course,179
k07-158-03,ok,not! I love him for what he is,186
k07-158-04,ok,- he's so great I'm a bit scared,182
k07-158-05,ok,of him - a woman must be a bit,179
k07-158-06,ok,scared to be really in love.,179
k07-158-07,ok,That's why you could never,175
k07-158-08,ok,love me?,175
k07-166-00,ok,"Correct, ducky! You just wait till",182
k07-166-01,err,you meet the girl who thinks you're a,180
k07-166-02,ok,god. It'll make you feel like one!,180
k07-166-03,ok,You think that sculptor's a god?,180
k07-166-04,ok,"Perhaps, in a way. All I know is",180
k07-166-05,err,that I need him. He kissed the,176
k07-166-06,ok,heart beat in her throat. But how,176
k07-166-07,ok,about the physical side? You're,176
k07-166-08,ok,quite an erotic little beast; can,173
k07-166-09,ok,he satisfy that?,169
k07-176-00,ok,You youngsters always overestimate,180
k07-176-01,ok,yourselves. You can take it from,180
k07-176-02,ok,me that he can and does. But,180
k07-176-03,ok,even if he were impotent I'd still,180
k07-176-04,ok,love and want him. There are,180
k07-176-05,ok,sides to me you'll never know.,176
k07-176-06,ok,Don't you feel guilty living with,176
k07-176-07,ok,me? Often! Don't you? Mary had,173
k07-176-08,ok,married her bill broker some time,176
k07-176-09,ok,ago and he now shuddered when he,173
k07-176-10,ok,remembered the clinical weekends,173
k07-176-11,ok,he used to spend with her.,173
k07-185-00,ok,He often used to try to imagine,180
k07-185-01,ok,her reactions if he had once treated,176
k07-185-02,ok,"her as he did Charlie, but his",180
k07-185-03,ok,imagination failed. The efficient,180
k07-185-04,ok,little Mary would probably have,176
k07-185-05,ok,called it a shocking waste of time,176
k07-185-06,err,and told him to get down to,173
k07-185-07,err,"business! Charlie, who was perfectly",176
k07-185-08,ok,at home at all sorts of artistic,173
k07-185-09,ok,"circles, had amongst others wangled",173
k07-185-10,ok,him a membership ticket for a,176
k07-185-11,err,small club for artists only.,173
l01-000-00,err,He did well. He got in touch with,182
l01-000-01,err,the woman Pete was passing off as his,182
l01-000-02,ok,mother. Starmouth managed to,182
l01-000-03,ok,win her confidence. It seems that,182
l01-000-04,ok,"she was an honest enough woman,",182
l01-000-05,err,only her mind wasn't as clear as,182
l01-000-06,ok,it could have been. She showed,182
l01-000-07,ok,him photographs. He found out,182
l01-000-08,err,that the name of her house - Grand,182
l01-000-09,err,Greve - was taken from a bay,182
l01-000-10,ok,in one of the Channel Islands.,182
l01-007-00,ok,"One of the small ones. Sark, that's it. The Caxtons",160
l01-007-01,ok,used to have their holidays there. Starmouth went,162
l01-007-02,ok,there. He dug out some people who remembered,164
l01-007-03,ok,the family. In the end he pieced it all together.,164
l01-007-04,ok,The Caxtons had two boys - Michael and Derek.,162
l01-007-05,err,Pete first met them at school.,162
l01-016-00,err,"It was a good school I sent him to, one of the best.",167
l01-016-01,ok,He was a boarder. He could always turn on the,170
l01-016-02,ok,charm when it suited him. The whole family,171
l01-016-03,ok,came to like him. The real Michael - he was the,170
l01-016-04,ok,same age as my son - died of pleurisy when he,168
l01-016-05,ok,was eighteen. Soon after that Pete staged his,168
l01-016-06,ok,drowning.,169
l01-023-00,ok,He was always a smooth liar. He invented some,167
l01-023-01,ok,plausible story or other and threw himself on,166
l01-023-02,err,the Caxtons' generosity. They accepted him as a,166
l01-023-03,ok,kind of substitute for the boy they had lost.,166
l01-023-04,ok,Outside the family he began to pass himself,163
l01-023-05,err,off as Michael Caxton. The father was well-off,163
l01-023-06,err,and easy-going. He was easy meat for Pete.,166
l01-030-00,ok,He sponged off him until he died,182
l01-030-01,ok,just after the war. Then Pete had to,182
l01-030-02,ok,look around for some other,182
l01-030-03,err,"security. He found it - Dackson's Wharf,",191
l01-030-04,err,and Dackson's daughter. Mrs. Caxton's,182
l01-030-05,err,"other boy, Derek, had been killed in the war.",182
l01-030-06,ok,After her husband died her brain began,182
l01-030-07,ok,to fade. At times she thought Pete was,182
l01-030-08,ok,really her own son.,182
l01-050-00,err,My chance had come at last. I had to,184
l01-050-01,ok,take it. I was going to smash him as,182
l01-050-02,ok,he had twice tried to smash me. (His,180
l01-050-03,ok,"eyes, wild and frightened, were fixed on",181
l01-050-04,ok,Tong. Tong guessed that they did not,182
l01-050-05,ok,see him.) I told Starmouth to go at,180
l01-050-06,ok,once and report exactly what he had,179
l01-050-07,ok,seen to Dackson and his daughter.,180
l01-050-08,ok,He did as he was told.,179

l01-065-04,ok,precise minute of Dackson's visit,189
l01-065-05,err,"the previous Wednesday, and ended",191
l01-065-06,err,by admitting that he was in fact,189
l01-065-07,err,at least half an hour late for,188
l01-065-08,err,"his appointment with her. ""There",187

l01-095-03,ok,only thing that saved her; it gave her the strength,197
l01-095-04,ok,she needed to fight for life. Soon she was out of,194

l01-095-06,err,have to remain in bed for some time and,191

l04-087-01,ok,Leaping forward with a choked sound he grasped the oblong,174

l04-153-04,ok,overwhelming. I spoke to a chap from the office of,185
l04-153-05,ok,the Director of Public Prosecutions I know pretty,184
l04-153-06,ok,"well, and he agreed that the missing cash is",186
l04-153-07,err,a hell of a mystery.,184
l04-159-00,ok,But as he quite reasonably pointed out the,186
l04-159-01,ok,money could have been disposed of in London,186
l04-159-02,ok,before your father left that evening. It wouldn't be,183
l04-159-03,ok,unnatural for a man in his position to make provision,182
l04-159-04,ok,for an unknown dependent or settle what he regarded,182
l04-159-05,ok,as particular debts of honour before taking his own,178

l04-159-08,ok,passing the car after your father was dead.,187
l04-163-00,err,Stealing from cars is about the commonest,157

l04-163-03,err,"circumstances of your father's death, that's",158
l04-163-04,ok,the point. Same with the passport. It's gone,158
l04-163-05,ok,and that's that. It may turn up in a dustbin,155
l04-163-06,ok,somewhere or at the back of a drawer. As,157

l07-131-03,ok,before I got used to calling them,182
l07-131-04,ok,portholes. The owner was a middle-aged,180

l07-135-05,ok,"departed with my cheque in his pocket,",178
l07-135-06,ok,Clive started the engine and gave me my,181

l07-138-03,ok,and I began to look forward to my life,185

l07-172-03,ok,live in. I was more than thankful for his help,179
l07-172-04,ok,when we had installed my things and the,179
l07-172-05,ok,boat began to move. The river was crowded,179

l07-181-02,err,"discover about him. ""You're wonderful,"" I",182
l07-181-03,ok,"said, meaning it. He pressed the tip of my",182

l07-181-05,ok,It was about eight o'clock in the evening,179

l07-187-07,ok,and there was a delicate iron staircase,180
l07-187-08,ok,climbing the outer wall to a room above.,176
l07-190-00,err,"""You won't see anyone tonight, it's too late,"" Max",186
l07-190-01,err,"said and turned to go. ""No - wait,"" I put out a",182
l07-190-02,ok,hand to stop him. The sun was no longer shining,182
l07-190-03,ok,"and it was dark across there by the trees,",186
l07-190-04,ok,but I thought I had seen something move.,182
m01-000-00,err,"A shudder, more mental than physical, ran",187

m01-000-02,ok,melt away into emptiness. His bulging,192
m01-000-03,ok,"eyes caught the reclining form of Heather,",193
m01-000-04,ok,who was still repeating in sing-song:,190
m01-000-05,ok,""". . . I will not give in. . ."" He stared at her",193
m01-000-06,err,"blankly, mouthing an incoherent gabble",190
m01-000-07,ok,of half words.,196
m01-012-00,ok,He slapped himself in the face and,187
m01-012-01,ok,cuffed the sides of his head. Then,187
m01-012-02,ok,by degrees the rotating objects,188
m01-012-03,ok,"slowed, and coming into focus took",189
m01-012-04,ok,the form of the furnishings in Dan,185
m01-012-05,ok,Brown's living room. He stood up un-,184
m01-012-06,ok,"steadily and looked about the room,",187
m01-012-07,ok,trying to gather his wits. Outside the,188
m01-012-08,ok,dusk was settling over Dow's Lake and,185
m01-012-09,err,the heights beyond were in,185
m01-012-10,ok,"silhouette, already a solid black.",186
m01-017-00,err,He bumped into a floor lamp and,175
m01-017-01,ok,switched it on. Heather McNabb still lay,171
m01-017-02,ok,"on the couch, her body uncomfortably twisted",173
m01-017-03,ok,and afflicted with occasional spasmodic jerks.,172
m01-017-04,ok,He went to the kitchen for water and found,170
m01-017-05,ok,Dan. Dan was lying on a long bench in the,171
m01-017-06,ok,"breakfast nook, his head bent upright",172
m01-017-07,ok,against the wall.,173
m01-022-00,ok,"His usually animated face was expressionless and looked flat,",191
m01-022-01,ok,as though his nose had been pushed back and his eyes and cheeks,190
m01-022-02,ok,"brought forward. He mouthed a low mutter, punctuated at intervals",187
m01-022-03,ok,with a few syllables of a crazy and incoherent jargon. As,189
m01-022-04,ok,"Steve looked at him his mouth suddenly snapped shut,",188
m01-022-05,ok,with jaws askew.,183
m01-026-00,ok,There was utter imbecility in his blank face. Presently the,177
m01-026-01,ok,"muttering started again, and went on and on. Stunned and",181
m01-026-02,ok,"shaken, Steve drew a glass of water and went back to",180
m01-026-03,ok,Heather. Half an hour later Heather and Steve were still,177
m01-026-04,ok,trying to shake-off the last traces of hypnotic after-effects.,178
m01-026-05,ok,For several minutes they had been facing each other across,175
m01-026-06,ok,"a low table, like two old convalescents thoroughly bored with",179
m01-026-07,ok,each other through forced association.,178
m01-032-00,ok,Then something like a zest for living began to come back,181
m01-032-01,ok,to Steve and he squeezed her hand. Her face took on,180
m01-032-02,ok,enough animation to produce a wan smile. Dan's low mut-,181
m01-032-03,ok,tering was just audible from the kitchen. And Steve,181
m01-032-04,ok,could see that as Heather recovered her senses and emotions,177
m01-032-05,ok,she was growing cold and numb with shock. She had seen,180
m01-032-06,ok,"Dan, or rather the physical relic of him - the empty",182
m01-032-07,ok,"shell of flesh and bone, devoid of intellect and",179
m01-032-08,err,personality.,178
m01-038-00,ok,"And these had been his great qualities,",159
m01-038-01,ok,so attractive to her. The Base Station had,156

m01-038-03,ok,4ementalating energy along the length of,156
m01-038-04,ok,"the Earth's imaginary longitudes, moving",154
m01-038-05,err,eastward like a knife-edged twilight in,155
m01-038-06,ok,reversed progression. It had brought the,156
m01-038-07,ok,"First Stage in the Thetan pattern of conquest,",155
m01-038-08,ok,the empty-minded receptiveness that,153
m01-038-09,ok,prepared the way for the Second Stage.,155
m01-049-00,ok,He rose from his breakfast-nook bench,186
m01-049-01,ok,"and came into the livingroom, where",187
m01-049-02,ok,Heather and Steve stood aghast at,188
m01-049-03,ok,"his entrance. He came, almost falling",188
m01-049-04,ok,"forward in an ungainly shuffle, neck",185
m01-049-05,ok,"thrust out, arms dangling loosely.",185
m01-049-06,ok,"Then, abruptly, he drew himself up",185
m01-049-07,ok,and walked on the very tips of,187
m01-049-08,ok,his toes. He stretched his arms,184
m01-049-09,err,"over his head and yawned agape,",184
m01-049-10,ok,drawing-in great breaths that,187
m01-049-11,err,became great sighs of ecstacy.,182
m01-060-00,err,"""They have come!"" he said reverently, gripping his",186
m01-060-01,err,hands together between his knees and leaning,184
m01-060-02,ok,"forward. ""Isn't it a glorious thing! Long awaited",186
m01-060-03,ok,"transcendent event, the exalted desire of all",183
m01-060-04,ok,mankind through all ages! The Kingdom of the,182
m01-060-05,ok,"Mind is at hand!"" He turned beaming eyes",180
m01-060-06,ok,upward and shook his head slowly from,183
m01-060-07,ok,side to side.,185
m01-079-00,ok,A superfluous precaution for there was no other car,203
m01-079-01,ok,abroad; and no pedestrian to cross his path nor to wait,203
m01-079-02,ok,at an intersection for the light to change. At his,203
m01-079-03,ok,apartment he garaged his car and then stood,191
m01-079-04,err,listening in the night. Listening in vain. For the,191
m01-079-05,err,"earth had lost its life-tempo, as the heart",191
m01-079-06,ok,loses its beat in death.,191
m01-084-00,ok,"Deadly stillness, deadly portent!",177
m01-084-01,ok,Steve awakened early and switched on,176
m01-084-02,err,"the radio, which he kept tuned to CBO.",177
m01-084-03,ok,The set lighted-up but gave only a low,177
m01-084-04,ok,buzzing sound. He had just finished,176
m01-084-05,ok,"shaving when it came on, with a flat",174
m01-084-06,ok,"voice repeating: ""This is BBC calling",176
m01-084-07,ok,". . . this is BBC calling. . .""",177
m01-090-00,ok,"After what seemed an undue period of repetition, the voice",194
m01-090-01,ok,went on to describe the landing of the Thetan colony,193
m01-090-02,ok,"in Sussex, in all its obscene details. Then the radio",192
m01-090-03,ok,"went dead again, and Steve had no stomach for",192
m01-090-04,ok,"breakfast. It was a beautiful day, as firsts-of-June",190
m01-090-05,ok,should be. Steve got out the car and traversed the,191
m01-090-06,ok,"same empty streets as he had the night before,",188
m01-090-07,ok,to keep an appointment with Heather.,189
m01-095-00,ok,Coming around the great mass of the Chateau,178
m01-095-01,ok,"Laurier, he braked to a screeching stop. A",179
m01-095-02,ok,flying saucer was tilting and dipping over,178
m01-095-03,ok,the War Memorial. There was a deep,179
m01-095-04,err,"whirring sound, and a high-pitched hissing",177
m01-095-05,ok,overtone that sang in his ears with an,175
m01-095-06,ok,almost painful sharpness. He reversed and,178
m01-095-07,ok,turned back on McKenzie Avenue.,178
m01-100-00,ok,The Thetans must not see him! He took another route,181
m01-100-01,ok,to Heather's and saw two more flying saucers on,185
m01-100-02,ok,the way. Heather was very anxious to visit Dan at,186
m01-100-03,ok,once; but Steve insisted that they should first discuss,187

m06-106-03,ok,and Haris there were many events. Chief of these was,159
m06-106-04,ok,that they learned to fly properly. The pains associated,158
m06-106-05,ok,with their wings soon died away as the wonderful,158
m06-106-06,ok,new flesh and tendon strengthened. To sail up in the,158

n01-000-00,ok,Alastair was a bachelor. All his life he had,190
n01-000-01,ok,been inclined to regard women as something,190
n01-000-02,ok,which must necessarily be subordinated to his,191
n01-000-03,ok,career. Now he realised that he was entrusting not only,190
n01-000-04,ok,"his own life, but Geoffrey's as well, to a strange girl",190
n01-000-05,ok,whom he had never met and on whom after no more,187
n01-000-06,ok,than a couple of telephone calls he was,189
n01-000-07,err,prepared to place complete reliance.,188
n01-004-00,ok,It was a novel experience. Alastair was,182
n01-004-01,ok,quite unable to explain why he should feel,180
n01-004-02,ok,so much confidence in her. Once again,182
n01-004-03,ok,she checked back her instructions. It was,179
n01-004-04,ok,obvious that she did not fail to appreciate the,177
n01-004-05,ok,faith which he was placing in her and,177
n01-004-06,ok,was prepared to accept the responsibility.,175
n01-009-00,err,"""Good luck, Air Marshal,"" she said gently. ""I'll",188
n01-009-01,err,be waiting for you at the Hotel Roma at six this,187

n01-009-03,ok,"both at midnight."" They might have been",186
n01-009-04,ok,arranging a supper party. Then she rang off.,184
n01-009-05,ok,Alastair admitted that never in a not altogether,181
n01-009-06,ok,uneventful life had he come across a girl who,185
n01-009-07,ok,sounded so charming and appeared to be so,186
n01-009-08,ok,efficient.,182
n01-020-00,ok,For some reason the orderlies had forgotten,172
n01-020-01,ok,to switch on the lights; there was no colour -,172
n01-020-02,ok,physical features were distinguishable solely by,172
n01-020-03,ok,gradations of silvery greyness. Even the snow-,173
n01-020-04,ok,"capped summit of Mont Blanc, seven miles",168
n01-020-05,ok,"below, was not recognisable among the host",167
n01-020-06,ok,of lower peaks. The screen of the air-to-air,172
n01-020-07,ok,radar glowed. Occasionally minute spots,171
n01-020-08,ok,"flickered across its surface, but there was",171
n01-020-09,err,no permanent image.,167
n01-031-00,ok,In the exceptional clarity he was even able to,171
n01-031-01,ok,make a direct comparison between the radar,170
n01-031-02,ok,image and the ground itself. Ahead lay the,170
n01-031-03,ok,"Plain of Lombardy; to the right, Turin; to the",170
n01-031-04,ok,"left, Milan. The directional angle of the",167
n01-031-05,ok,scanner could be adjusted to cover any,168
n01-031-06,ok,particular area within its range. Geoffrey,170
n01-031-07,err,turned the scale slowly to cover the,168
n01-031-08,ok,ground immediately ahead.,167
n01-036-00,ok,"He was able to pick out towns, unrecognisable to the",194
n01-036-01,ok,"naked eye, obscured by the ground haze which even",194
n01-036-02,ok,on the clearest night limited angular vision. He glanced,191
n01-036-03,ok,at the speed recorder. It seemed almost incredible that,190
n01-036-04,ok,the tiny white figure of 8.5 against which the needle,187
n01-036-05,ok,was resting could really mean hundreds of knots.,186
n01-045-00,ok,"Now, as Alastair reduced the thrust, the",173
n01-045-01,ok,pitch changed as the nose of the aircraft,174
n01-045-02,ok,dipped slightly. The needle of the speed,172
n01-045-03,err,"recorder swung gently through 8.0, 7.0, 6.0",174
n01-045-04,ok,"before coming to rest at 5.0. ""We're a bit",173
n01-045-05,err,"ahead of time,"" said Alastair. ""We'll run",170
n01-045-06,err,"in on minimum engine power."" Geoffrey",172
n01-045-07,ok,smiled. Alastair talked of running in when,171
n01-045-08,ok,they were still more than four hundred,169
n01-045-09,ok,miles from their destination.,169
n01-052-00,ok,They were nearing Modena. Geoffrey focused the radar scanner,152
n01-052-01,err,"on the bridge over the Po, barely forty miles to port.",154
n01-052-02,err,He was able to trace the course of the river; he,153
n01-052-03,err,"thought he could recognise the route of N12,",153
n01-052-04,err,along which he had motored so desperately little,151
n01-052-05,err,more than twenty-four hours earlier. Since then,149

n01-052-11,err,of the journey back to the place where every,151
n01-052-12,err,indication pointed to Eve being held.,150
n01-057-00,ok,Geoffrey set himself to consider the,179
n01-057-01,ok,movements of the Bentley. It had passed,179
n01-057-02,ok,him at the temporary bridge over the,179
n01-057-03,ok,Tartaro at a few minutes past ten on the,178
n01-057-04,ok,previous night. He worked out the distance,178
n01-057-05,ok,on the presumption that its route had been,175
n01-057-06,ok,through Florence and Rome and then,176
n01-057-07,ok,across Italy via Foggia to Barletta.,178
n01-057-08,ok,It came to just over six hundred,175
n01-057-09,ok,miles.,175
n02-000-00,ok,DARKNESS had descended like a curtain by the,177
n02-000-01,ok,"time they docked at Belleray. And though Guy,",176
n02-000-02,ok,"made nervous by Beryl's silence, drove at reckless",176
n02-000-03,ok,"speed to the Villa, it was quickly evident that",177
n02-000-04,ok,the party was over. Piers came strolling out to,176
n02-000-05,ok,"meet the Deanes, and as soon as Guy had",174
n02-000-06,ok,"driven away, invited them casually to come to",175
n02-000-07,ok,his flat for a drink.,174
n02-004-00,ok,"To Beryl, at least, this was anti-climax with a",164
n02-004-01,ok,vengeance. She had expected to be met with violent,164
n02-004-02,ok,reproaches - and here he was bland and smiling.,164
n02-004-03,ok,But it did not take her long to realise that his mood,165
n02-004-04,ok,was less pleasant than appeared on the surface.,159
n02-004-05,ok,"He told her nonchalantly, as he led the way to his",162
n02-004-06,ok,"own veranda, that he had taken the liberty of",162
n02-004-07,ok,asking Jack - as a representative of the Vallin family -,162
n02-004-08,ok,to come over and make the presentation in her stead.,160
n02-009-00,ok,"""I caught him just as he was going to the",166

n02-009-02,ok,of fact I'd asked him last night to deputise,164
n02-009-03,ok,for me and fetch her. He brought her to the party,164
n02-009-04,err,"too. They're both here."" ""I didn't know she was",160
n02-009-05,err,"coming back from Barbados so soon."" Beryl",160
n02-009-06,ok,said the first thing that came into her head.,161
n02-016-00,err,"""Oh, she was due!"" And then he added in the same",175
n02-016-01,ok,"casual tone, ""She's not returning to her family. She's",175
n02-016-02,ok,"going to live with friends of the bank manager, just",172
n02-016-03,ok,"this side of Belleray."" Mrs. Deane made a suitable",175
n02-016-04,ok,"comment, but Beryl said nothing. She was trying",172
n02-016-05,ok,to sort things out in her mind. That beneath his,170
n02-016-06,ok,unnaturally smooth exterior Piers was simmering,173
n02-016-07,ok,with anger against her she had no doubt.,174
n02-028-00,err,"Jack and Blanche were quick to sympathise, and to",176
n02-028-01,err,express their disgust at Sir John's abominable treatment,179
n02-028-02,err,"of his guests. But Piers remained aloof, and when Beryl",180
n02-028-03,err,"suggested having a second party, the following week, he",174
n02-028-04,err,"poured cold water on the project. Everyone, he declared,",173
n02-028-05,ok,"had had a thoroughly good time, and it would take them",179
n02-028-06,ok,nearly to next week to settle down again. Meanwhile,177
n02-028-07,ok,Hubert would have betaken himself and his well-,172
n02-028-08,err,earned gratuity to his native village at the,175
n02-028-09,err,north of the island.,178
n02-033-00,ok,It was all over and done with.,162
n02-033-01,ok,For the time being Beryl was content to let,152
n02-033-02,ok,"it go at that, but she resolved to have",152
n02-033-03,ok,it out with Piers when a reasonable,152
n02-033-04,ok,opportunity presented itself. He must,149
n02-033-05,ok,learn that he could not treat her,149
n02-033-06,ok,"with injustice and contempt, ignoring",152
n02-033-07,ok,her explanations as though he were,149
n02-033-08,ok,"a schoolmaster and she a small,",149
n02-033-09,ok,ignorant child.,149
n02-037-00,ok,He gave her no chance of any private,152

n02-037-02,ok,"Blanche and Jack left, he went with",149
n02-037-03,ok,them. But next morning she insisted,149
n02-037-04,ok,on his taking her out in the jeep -,149
n02-037-05,ok,"to find, if possible, Hubert and his",149
n02-037-06,err,"relations, and tell them of",149

n02-040-00,ok,"With an air of resignation he sent Judy, his",170
n02-040-01,ok,"Boxer, to the back, and made room for her",170
n02-040-02,ok,"beside him. ""Is that all you want to do?""",169

r06-003-04,err,"day, with the help of the Syndicat d'Initiative, we had been",183
r06-003-05,ok,"hunting for furnished rooms, and had given up, when an",182
r06-003-06,err,"elderly lady, the owner of a residence called the Poet's Nest,",182
r06-003-07,ok,had firmly closed the door in our noses.,182
r06-007-00,ok,"'It is a pity,' said Mart, 'because it would have been",184
r06-007-01,ok,"a good address.' Now, after a woman's radar look,",183
r06-007-02,ok,she decided Pierre would solve our problems. This,181
r06-007-03,err,"was true, Pierre was a true Provenc*?6al, thin and",183
r06-007-04,ok,"yellow as lemon peel, wrestling with some gnawing rat",182
r06-007-05,ok,"of an illness, man of all trades, married to a commanding",182

r06-007-07,ok,accumulation of money.,180
r06-011-00,ok,"We went in. There were a few people in the bar,",184
r06-011-01,ok,"elderly, well-off, artistic, who, you felt, had made a hard",183
r06-011-02,ok,"bargain for giving up. 'I have furnished rooms,' said",184
r06-011-03,err,"Pierre, 'and all mod cons.' The price was 16,000 francs a",184
r06-011-04,err,"month. 'Yes,' we said immediately, even before viewing.",182
r06-011-05,ok,We were shown around by Pierre.,181
r06-018-00,err,The flat was on the third floor; two rooms; soft Provenc*?,184

r06-018-02,ok,"hot water from Butagas installation for washing-up,",182
r06-018-03,ok,"basin and bidet; own private, modern lavatory. The",181
r06-018-04,ok,first night's sleeping was like a long convalescence.,182
r06-018-05,ok,We were woken up twice about dawn by a soft,181
r06-018-06,ok,eruption of turtle-doves.,180
r06-022-00,ok,"This was strange, even magic, because the owner's",186
r06-022-01,ok,"name was Pierre Tortorolo which, in Nicoison Italian means",184
r06-022-02,ok,'turtledove'. Pierre Turtledove. When we woke up properly it,184
r06-022-03,ok,"was raining, an even more hopeless rain than London, and we",184
r06-022-04,ok,looked out of the windows at the weeping trees and the,183
r06-022-05,ok,curling white breath of the mountains. The land looked,182
r06-022-06,ok,like a beaten woman and the turtle-doves cried her,182
r06-022-07,ok,shame.,179
r06-027-00,ok,"There they were, in fact, below us, eight of them.",185
r06-027-01,ok,"Four of them were flattened on the window sills, two",185
r06-027-02,ok,"immolated on a nearby roof top, the other pair copulating.",183
r06-027-03,ok,We had a morning at Pierre's. He talked about people.,182
r06-027-04,ok,Marc Chagall used to live here and an Englishman named,183
r06-027-05,ok,"Lawrence. He was here, near the railway station, three or",182
r06-027-06,ok,"four years. During this period he wrote a book,",181
r06-027-07,ok,The Lover of Lady Chatterly.,181
r06-035-00,ok,"No, he hadn't read it; Madame did all the",171
r06-035-01,ok,reading. Lawrence died in this very place.,174
r06-035-02,ok,He used to come to Pierre's Bar again and,174
r06-035-03,err,"again. No, he couldn't really remember",174
r06-035-04,ok,"him, he was one of the crowd. The",174
r06-035-05,ok,sun came out; Mart went shopping; I,173
r06-035-06,ok,sat in the square reading the Patriote.,173
r06-041-00,ok,There was a front-page rear-attack on de,176
r06-041-01,err,"Gaulle, and the rest of the paper was given up",175
r06-041-02,err,"to murders, apart for an outcry against a",174

r06-041-04,ok,the Mediterranean between Corsica and St,173
r06-041-05,ok,Raphael. All the murders were well documented,173
r06-041-06,ok,and had the air of being written by an,175
r06-041-07,ok,"ingenious, but mad film director of the",174
r06-041-08,ok,Thirties.,171
r06-044-00,err,They mostly occurred in lonely farm-houses.,176
r06-044-01,ok,"Monsieur H, for instance, had been clubbed and",174
r06-044-02,ok,"throttled to death by his wife, children and",174
r06-044-03,ok,"father-in-law, after muddling up some sheep",174
r06-044-04,ok,while the worse for drink. The family,176
r06-044-05,ok,group then sat down for a late lunch,174
r06-044-06,ok,before the father-in-law telephoned the police.,173
r06-044-07,ok,"Then again, Monsieur V, owing to family",173
r06-044-08,ok,"troubles, had written to the local",173
r06-044-09,ok,"paper and the superintendent of police,",173
r06-044-10,ok,informing them that he was on the point,173
r06-049-00,ok,Monsieur V's house was immediately,172
r06-049-01,ok,"surrounded by firemen and other officials,",173
r06-049-02,ok,but there was no Monsieur V. He telephoned,173
r06-049-03,ok,"a few minutes later from a nearby village,",172
r06-049-04,ok,"apologising for the trouble, but explaining",173
r06-049-05,ok,that the walls were porous and the,174
r06-049-06,ok,gas had escaped. General relief was,174
r06-049-07,ok,"expressed, but Monsieur V (this was",171
r06-049-08,ok,actually reported in the next issue) returned,171
r06-049-09,ok,"home and shot himself, leaving a note",173
r06-049-10,ok,which again left his household goods,173
r06-053-00,ok,Some grim comic relief was provided by,175
r06-053-01,ok,an elderly farm labourer out for a shoot,173
r06-053-02,ok,who hid himself in a bush and imitated,172
r06-053-03,ok,a blackbird. Unfortunately a sporting taxi-driver,174
r06-053-04,ok,was after this very bird and shot the farm-,175
r06-053-05,ok,"labourer in the face. All, however,",172
r06-053-06,err,"ended well, reported the paper, since the",173
r06-053-07,ok,pellets were easily removed and the,172
r06-053-08,ok,labourer was able to return to work the,170
r06-053-09,ok,same afternoon.,171
r06-057-00,err,We travelled down to Nice on the Lambretta.,175
r06-057-01,ok,You can free-wheel down a quarter of the,176
r06-057-02,ok,way. In the middle of the journey is a,174
r06-057-03,ok,valley with a sea of vines and olives,173
r06-057-04,ok,and beaches of earth pricked to blood by,173

r06-062-00,ok,There is a curd of morning smoke and,178
r06-062-01,ok,a muffled bell taps the sky. Here we,176
r06-062-02,ok,"stopped, as in fine weather we always",178
r06-062-03,ok,stopped. Down below is the village of,176
r06-062-04,ok,"Cagnes, but between are pockets of",178
r06-062-05,ok,heat and cold like the hands of,175
r06-062-06,ok,"friends or strangers, and a flurry of",179
r06-062-07,ok,"early smells, the dark bosoms of",177
r06-062-08,ok,beech and the thin pine fingers,177
r06-062-09,ok,kissed by the sun.,173

r06-066-06,err,"to the old sleeping port. This, and",171

r06-066-08,ok,could catch the taste of dead dreams on,171
r06-066-09,ok,my tongue like spray.,170
r06-070-00,ok,We parked the Lambretta opposite the,171
r06-070-01,ok,"Negresco, and went to the beach to",174
r06-070-02,ok,have a swim. Amazing bedlam rocked,175
r06-070-03,ok,"in our eyes. The sea boiled with waves,",175
r06-070-04,ok,they galloped to the walls and spumed,174
r06-070-05,ok,over the Promenade des Anglais. A huge,173
r06-070-06,ok,crowd had collected. There were firemen,172
r06-070-07,ok,"and policemen and ambulances, and the",174
r06-070-08,ok,eyes of the spectators were hard with,173
r06-070-09,err,disaster.,173
r06-076-00,ok,They all had that neat look of,176

r06-076-08,ok,bloody child at the crossroads.,173
r06-090-00,ok,It was growing cold. We left the,189
r06-090-01,ok,crowd and drove back to Vence.,189
r06-090-02,ok,The cool evening perfumes stood,190

r06-090-04,ok,Mart is unable to smell (her sense,189

r06-090-06,ok,"I had to explain the low, sharp and",186
r06-090-07,ok,sweet signals in the air. When we,188

r06-090-09,ok,"London sickness (a sense of guilt,",187
r06-090-10,ok,mingled with the memory of sandwiches,187
r06-097-00,err,We went straight to bed and slept until,187
r06-097-01,ok,the turtle-doves drummed up the,186

r06-097-05,ok,"Mart had been right, the body had been",186
r06-097-06,ok,a woman's. It belonged to a Madame,187
r06-097-07,ok,N. Enquiries had been made in the,187
r06-097-08,ok,"neighbourhood, and it transpired that",186
r06-097-09,ok,Madame N's husband had made an,187

r06-103-00,err,"The sister, able to swim, had returned",186

r06-103-02,ok,to her brother-in-law (with whom,185
r06-103-03,ok,"she had an illicit relationship), she",186
r06-103-04,ok,went to her fiance*?2's house and,186

r06-106-03,ok,"to leave at eleven, but she arrived",184
r06-106-04,ok,"at nine. Her blue dress was new,",185
r06-106-05,ok,and so were her fashionable shoes. Her,183
r06-106-06,ok,hair had just been done. She looked,183
r06-106-07,ok,more than ever like a pink and gold,184
r06-106-08,ok,Renoir girl who expects everything from,182
r06-106-09,ok,life.,181
r06-111-00,ok,Catherine lives in a white house,181
r06-111-01,err,overlooking the sweeping brown tides,183
r06-111-02,ok,of the river. She helped me clean up my,183
r06-111-03,ok,flat with a devotion which said that,183
r06-111-04,ok,she felt small flats were altogether more,184
r06-111-05,ok,romantic than large houses. We drank,181
r06-111-06,ok,"tea, and talked mainly about Philip, who,",182
r06-111-07,err,"being 15, has pure stern tastes in every-",184
r06-111-08,ok,thing from food to music.,182
r06-115-00,ok,Catherine looked at the books lying,183
r06-115-01,ok,"around his room, and asked if she",182
r06-115-02,ok,might borrow the stories of Isaac Babel,183
r06-115-03,ok,to read on the train. Catherine is 13.,182
r06-115-04,err,I suggested she might find them dif-,185
r06-115-05,err,"ficult, but she said, 'Philip reads them,",183
r06-115-06,err,doesn't he?' During the journey I read,184
r06-115-07,ok,newspapers and watched her pretty,183
r06-115-08,ok,frowning face as she turned the,183
r06-115-09,ok,"pages of Babel, for she was determined",183
r06-115-10,ok,to let nothing get between her and,181

r06-121-01,ok,"vilised and expensive, the two children",185

r06-121-04,ok,their bright friendly heads turned,184
r06-121-05,ok,towards each other as they talked. In,183
r06-121-06,ok,Catherine's left hand she carried the,183
r06-121-07,ok,stories of Isaac Babel. After lunch we,185
r06-121-08,ok,went to the pictures. Philip allowed,182
r06-121-09,ok,# it to be seen that he thought going to,183
r06-121-10,ok,the pictures just for the fun of it was,183
r06-126-00,ok,For his sake we chose the more,184
r06-126-01,ok,serious of the two films that were,186
r06-126-02,ok,showing in the little town. It was,184
r06-126-03,ok,about a good priest who helped cri-,185
r06-126-04,ok,"minals in New York. His goodness, how-",185
r06-126-05,ok,"ever, was not enough to prevent one",183
r06-126-06,ok,of them from being sent to the gas,183
r06-126-07,ok,chamber; and Philip and I waited with,184
r06-126-08,ok,Catherine in the dark until she had stopped,183
r06-126-09,ok,crying and could face the light of a golden,186
r06-126-10,ok,evening.,185
r06-130-00,ok,At the entrance of the cinema the,184
r06-130-01,ok,doorman was lying in wait for anyone,184
r06-130-02,err,who had red eyes. Grasping Catherine,183
r06-130-03,ok,"by her suffering arm, he said bitterly:",182
r06-130-04,ok,"'Yes, why are you crying, he had to be",185
r06-130-05,ok,"punished for his crime, didn't he?' Cathe-",182
r06-130-06,ok,"rine stared at him, incredulous. Philip",181
r06-130-07,ok,rescued her by saying with disdain:,183
r06-130-08,ok,'Some people don't know right from wrong,181
r06-130-09,ok,even when its demonstrated to them.',181
r06-137-00,ok,The doorman turned his attention,180
r06-137-01,ok,to the next red-eyed emerger from the,184
r06-137-02,ok,dark; and we went on together to,183
r06-137-03,ok,"the station, the children silent because",183
r06-137-04,ok,of the cruelty of the world. Finally Catherine,182
r06-137-05,ok,"said, her eyes wet again: 'I think its all",183
r06-137-06,ok,"absolutely beastly, and I can't bear to think",180
r06-137-07,ok,about it.' And Philip said: 'But we've got,185
r06-137-08,ok,"to think about it, don't you see, because",182
r06-137-09,ok,"if we don't it'll just go on and on, don't",182
r06-137-10,ok,you see?',184
r06-143-00,ok,In the train going back to London I sat,186
r06-143-01,ok,beside # Catherine. She had the stories open,185
r06-143-02,ok,"in front of her, but she said: 'Philip's awfully lucky.",186
r06-143-03,ok,I wish I went to that school. Did you notice,184
r06-143-04,ok,that girl who said hullo to him in the garden?,186
